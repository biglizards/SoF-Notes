The Empress of the Valiant Empire has sent out The Cormorant, a trade ship and one of the last in their navy to The Carmine Isles to pick up some important cargo. The mission aims to demonstrate that the navy is still capable by navigating a fairly new trade route which avoids Marrodic waters.

The curtains open as the ship arrives in the Bom La, in the Carmine Isles, and the crew are sent off to enjoy themselves for the rest of the day. The captain and viscount, along with a few of the guards, head out to load the important cargo into the lazarette, which has a securely locked door and is constantly guarded.

Marcos, Syrana, and Rivik are recruited, and Delwyn is converted to the accorder faith by Father Laronis.

The crew return and the ship leaves port, heading back to Yrah. On the way, a strong and unseasonal storm whips up, Lurgin is crushed by cargo, and Zet falls from the rigging while attempting to take the sails down after they were struck by lightning and set aflame. Ancaratt climbs the mast and cuts the sail free, saving the ship from burning.

A rumour quickly spreads around the crew that whatever's in the lazarette caused this storm - a ship carrying gold or silver, so the superstition says, is much more likely to be claimed by the sea.

Seeing the crew stressed by the storm, the captain orders the mercenaries to stand around looking imposing, and the viscount orders a second guard to the lazarette. On coming down, a hole is found in the cargo hold's hull, which is eventually patched up. The viscount enters the lazarette, and then leaves after a few minutes, sending Petro down to relieve one of the door guards on their way out.

Taking advantage of the atmosphere and number of crew in the hold, Nerova riles up several crew members into demanding the lazarette be opened. Father Laronis calmly argues that the crew have a right to know what they're transporting, and the newly converted Delwyn steps up to Crion, who is guarding the door along with Syrana.

Crion stabs Delwyn, fatally wounding him, and he dies in the chaplain's arms. Horton charges at the door and Syrana slices his head clean off. Nerova grapples with Crion, and uses him to block an attack from Syrana, but is knocked unconscious after being hit by a crossbow.

That night, Crion, vulnerable from his wound, is killed in his sleep. The captain assumes this was Rhys taking revenge, and orders him to walk the plank. Rhys is quickly converted by the chaplain, to Ancaratt's chagrin, and walks into the sea.

The ship makes an emergency stop in Tekitara, the one city in Grehvoldur known to be free of the plague, in dire need of repairs, supplies, and replacement crew. The sailors are sent to a nearby smoking house (the equivalent of a tavern, since strong alcohol is prohibited in the city) while the ship is moved into a drydock.

Father Laronis wants to give Delwyn a proper Accorder burial. Conscious of plague, however, the border guards require the body is burnt, and suggest the nearby flametouched temple. While fetching the body, Laronis and Ancaratt catch Marcos knocking on the door of the room-turned-prison cell Nerova is being housed in, and quickly retreat to inform the viscount.

Aiming to keep an eye on Marcos, the viscount requests that he accompanies the group as they venture onto land to burn the body. Marcos insists on speaking with Nerova first, claiming they thought they could learn more about them as they both spoke Marrodic. They speak for a time, and Marcos reports they gleamed no useful information. Laronis immediately realises this is a lie, and discreetly informs the viscount of this.

Laronis, Ancaratt, Marcos, Lassrin, Petro, and the Viscount head towards the temple, but are stopped by [[Karishna]], an abnormally enthusiastic street food vendor who despite the language barrier manages to convince Petro and Lassrin to try her fish stew. She picks Petro's pocket, pilfering 6 silver coins. Seeing this, she grins suspiciously, and Petro realises his wallet is missing, but insists he must simply have left it on the ship.

The group reach the temple of the Flametouched, a heretical offshoot of Accorders who believe it's possible to carry the flame within one's body (few regular Accorders exist in Grehvoldur, as they won't send ships capable of carrying the flame there for fear of infection). Father Laronis speaks to Father Dariun and arranges for a cremation, hoping that, while this is a significant departure from his standard funeral rites, it should be better than nothing. Ancaratt conducts the traditional Kremish funeral rite of screaming as loudly as possible for the Pale Lady to collect her soul.

Afterwords, the Viscount leads everyone into a prayer room - notably containing a giant stone face, rumoured to be both sentient and very intolerant of crime, at the far end - in order to interrogate Marcos. Partway through, Karishna barges past the door guards in order to, panting, explain that Petro dropped 2 silver coins while at her stand. Nobody buys it, but the confusion is enough for Marcos to escape, pursued closely by Petro, and at a distance by the significantly less athletic Viscount.

In the prayer room, Karishna gathers some coins from the floor - the stone face, likely used as a shrine, had some in its mouth, and they spilt out during the altercation. Sensing impending desecration, both Father Laronis and the face object: the former issues pleas muffled by the language barrier, and a gust of wind from the mouth of the latter snuffs out the torches, leaving only the glimmer of a gemstone resting on the floor. Echoes of rock scraping against rock whisper in greytongue, understood as language only by Karishna.

"Come closer, Thief"

Finally seeing sense, she flees, and later tearfully confesses to a priest and attempts to be converted, much to the (slightly cautions) excitement of Father Laronis.

Meanwhile, in the main hall of the temple, Petro and Marcos are fighting. Marcos says something impossible to think about or remember, and part of the roof collapses directly onto Petro, who dodges but loses sight of Marcos. Lassrin and the Viscount catch up, Lassrin volunteers to search for Marcos, as he knows the local language, and Petro runs back to the ship to tell the captain and guards what happened, and that Marcos should not be let back onto the ship. Karishna and Father Laronis stay to repair the temple, as penance and in hope of reforming the thief respectively. 

Ancaratt and the Viscount set up a stall in a sanctioned area by the docks in hope of attracting more sailors - a half dozen or so would be needed to ensure a safe return journey. Two married carpenters, one of which spoke some broken Varlish, approach hoping to migrate to Yrah, but request 4 silver in advance (instead of what would normally be 2 paid at the end of the voyage) to pay off their debts to the carpenters' guild. They are given the money, and are told to return in 3 days.

Increasingly paranoid there's still a traitor among the crew, the Viscount orders Nerova to be moved to a different cabin, and stations Petro in the old one, hoping to catch out anyone attempting to break her out again.

That night, a note is slipped under the door of Nerova's new cell, reporting that the door is unlocked and her weapons and armour are stored at the far end of the cargo hold. Realising this is in the direct line of sight of the lazarette guard, Nerova assumes some kind of entrapment and instead leaves the ship, finding herself in a dry dock with only one, guarded, exit. She walks past the guards with an air of confidence, but they stop her anyway, and - when she is unable to provide any papers - is tackled to the ground and taken to the captain.

An investigation finds that cloth had been stuck inside the locking mechanism, preventing it from closing properly. Nerova claims this was her doing, but reasoning that whichever guard locked the door should have noticed it wasn't locking properly, continued to suspect it was one of the guards. Resolving to investigate tomorrow, everyone goes back to sleep, and no further escape attempts are made.

Karishna awakes to find two thugs walking purposefully towards her, Fathers Laronis and Dariun in tow. She immediately leaps to her feat and nocks an arrow to the longbow she kept under her pillow, which only seems to amuse the thugs. After some back and forth, everyone gives their weapons to Fathers Laronis, who is designated to watch the negations from out of earshot.

The thugs, members of the Bat Boilers, a local gang notable for eating the vampire bats native to the caverns in which they reside, inform Karishna that she has racked up a serious debt by operating her business in the gang's territory, but that they're willing to forgive the debt if she can bring the Viscount into a particular smoking house where she is to be ambushed and held for ransom. Karishna successfully demands a 25% cut of the profits from this, and the thugs collect their weapons and leave. Seeing this, even without knowing any of the details shakes any faith Fathers Laronis had in Karishna.



Ancaratt leaves the inn in which she spent the night, and, while trying to find a library, realises she's being followed by a dishevelled Marcos. Ancaratt calls out, and the two walk for a while before heading into an alleyway to talk. Marcos, knowing he will soon be caught by the magistrates, suggests a desperate play to Ancaratt: lure the Viscount into a _different_ ambush and steal her keys. Ancaratt agrees, and eventually heads back to the ship.


At noon, by the stall used the previous day, Ancaratt, the Viscount and Petro, Lassrin, and Father Laronis (brazenly followed by Karishna) meet. Seeing the Viscount, Karishna sprints forwards and then breathlessly and incoherently blabbers something about a conspiracy to blow up the ship, there's already people on board, but you need to come to this smoking house, yes there's an ambush but it'd be good experience for your guards, no I can't leave they'll know I failed and they'll kill me.

Lassrin excuses himself to actually go look for recruits, having picked out a viable location - "the ledge" - from Karishna's otherwise incoherent ramblings. Ancaratt suggests she _also_ found some big strong men at their inn yesterday and that the Viscount should visit to recruit them personally (as they'd respond better to seeing such a wealthy individual in person). The Viscount reluctantly agrees, and motions to have Karishna arrested.

Father Laronis, already desolated by the depraved behaviour of the supposedly converted Karishna, realises with total conviction that Ancaratt is lying - is _everyone_ lying to him? He begins to snap, but, perhaps due to divine intervention from the Goddess herself, his eyes instead shine with rage and holy light. Recalling the passage in which the prophet Azur confronts a traitorous once-friend, he grabs hold of Ancaratt's and demands she tells the truth.

Ancaratt flippantly claims to have intended to jump and kill the Viscount, but upon lying their tongue transforms into a snake and spills out of their mouth. Someone cries out "Cobra!" and a crowd starts to form, with one person helpfully attempting to sneak up and cut the throat of the snake. Ancaratt draws their sword and motions them to not do that, and they return to the crowd.

Sensing the plan had failed somehow, Marcos, who had been hiding in the crowd, leaps out and attacks Petro with a cosh. Another member of the crowd, recognising Karishna as the person who robbed them last week, leaps out to attack her. Karishna kicks them to the ground, cuts off their ear, and they crawl away. Karishna flees, using the battle as cover.

Ancaratt convinces Father Laronis to stand down, and motions for Petro and the Viscount to do the same. They keep their weapons raised and pointing at Marcos, demanding he leaves immediately. Marcos, having been still and muttering to himself for a while, screams something in Marrodic. A huge stalactite from the cavern roof breaks off, killing Petro and the Viscount instantly. Laronis runs over to Petro's body, and prays for another miracle to heal him, but nothing happens.

Ancaratt rummages around in the rubble, and finds the ship's keys flung to one side. They tell the Father to come with them, to finally see what lies behind the lazarette door. The two head back to the ship, leaving Markus to seek out the crew in their smoking house in hopes of riling them up to mutiny.

Father Laronis, master of deception, convinces the the captain to leave the ship to investigate the disturbance - the crash of the stalactite could be heard even from the dry docks. He then heads down to the hold, convincing the guard to leave for a moment: "all hands on deck, the captain has left and the ship is in danger!" Meanwhile, Ancaratt frees Nerova, and the two sneak into the now-unguarded hold.

The door is unlocked and swings open, the stench of humanity - sweat and excrement - rushes out, finally free. Inside the windowless room, a figure with long white hair and weathered skin sits chained up against the wall, sleeping. Nerova recognises them immediately as a personal hero, captain of a Revic ship refusing to honour an almost thirty year old peace treaty.

"*This* is Gutslash Gulla, Marrodic battlesaint and scourge of the Valiant Empire"

Laronis, however, gripped by paranoia and righteous fervor, saw not a human, but a demon. They recall reading that although demons have no heart, to kill one you must pierce the space it should occupy with holy flame. Still holding the key, he thrusts it towards Gulla's chest, and as he does it grows a shell of radiant light in the shape of a dagger. Nerova slashes at his face, but the chaplain is determined and unflinching, and thrusts the key into the demon. Gulla's body is engulfed in flame, save the area directly around her metal collar.

"I curse this ship!", she howls. "Should it return, it will bring only ruin!"

Nerova throws Laronis to the floor and raises her sword. With a look of total satisfaction, he says "blessings." and offers no resistance as he is hacked to pieces. The two hear a sharp gasp, and turn to see the door guard on the stairs. Mad with bloodlust, Nerova charges to her death in glorious battle. 

Having witnessed the death of all who could be called friends, a destroyed homeland and no way to return to it, Ancaratt moves for the first time since the lazarette was opened, slicing open her gut and allowing her blood to mix with the others'.
