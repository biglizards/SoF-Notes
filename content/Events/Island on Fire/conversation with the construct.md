has magic:
- can control things telekenetically by moving its claws (closing door, causing ceiling to collapse)
- can damage/destroy things by conjuring a ring around them
	- it's thin, like a thread (almost 2d), and light blue (faintly glowing) similar to sunlight water
	- doesn't do anything until the ring is complete
	- doesn't appear to instantly destroy it - the pillars started to crumble over time

- has telekinesis
