Astrid leaves the room as Ranvig opens and reads the will. She spends a little while reading impassionately, occasionally jotting down notes. She occasionally raises her eyebrows, and halfway through she suppresses a bit of a chuckle. She raises her eyebrows and nods subtle twice around 2/3rs of the way down. A slight twitch of a smile at the end, and she looks genuinely respectful, as if suddenly taken with some part of this. 

She restamps the seal, and confirms that both Astrid and Aethild feature in the will.
