Jovian Palantina - the mendicant
Aethild - the baneman
Jago and Juevo

**Mara 10th of summer**

Keybearer elected - it's Astrid Knutsdir. A wax seal is placed over the keyhole bearing the seal of the three corners sanctuary.

We compile a shopping list, and then head out to find the goods:
- poleman is getting a lockbox for party valuables
- aethild and astrid are getting a horse and a cart
- jovian and karisma are getting food, water, and feed

[[Poleman]] heads to the temple to ask around and see what locksmith they use. Runs into Dimion Corbulo - mandy dealer and street fighting ring participant. Poleman buys a month's worth and tries a bit - it's stronger than usual.

He heads through the recently installed golden doors of the church, past the three monkeys. asks for markos, the guy in charge, and finds him in his office. Asks where to find a locksmith, and markos sings about "rudeous fox, down by the docks". Poleman moves to leave, hits his head on the doors and falls down.

Slightly more sober, he mentions TERSIUS fox and that was actually a guy who wrote a book called "on the applications of tallow in cartography". Markos gives me a map and tells me that actually sister helva knows where i can find the locksmith. I ask her and get referred to rusen's locks.

The locksmith is out on buisness, but her husband is still there and sells a chest for 2s and gives poleman a haircut for 5c.

Someone threw a chamber pot on a passing noble (don creso, presumably by mistake). Aethild suggested that they should consume the urine of the chamber pot's owner else get dysentery. The noble, identifying the baneman as a "problem solver" sends them into their house. They meet a woman (hilda, maid?) who identifies the chamberpot's owner as lusenna, who has been locked in her room on account of madness. Heads up the stairs and meets cpl Klaus, wielding an improvised weapon. Aethild offers his services and it's seemingly accepted.

talking to Tommy toggles came threw window told her pot of gold had been placed on the roof. knicker knacker put down oil causing her to slip (she gestures at dry floor boards). 

"watch yourself longfingers has you by the shoulder"

Aethild gets some piss from Lusenna and adds it into the sweetbread mix being prepared by Hilda.

Astrid gets talking with the noble and mentions looking for a courser. the noble is trying to push some performance enhancing drugs and recommends a specific stable (peddler's paradise). i think something else shady happened too?? i wasn't paying attention. offers a horse/cart for some kind of service? seems plausible

Aethild forces the noble to eat the sweetbread (witchcake), he complains it's weirdly bitter and sweet.

[[Karishna]] goes to the baker to get some rations. there's some orphans begging for bread and the baker specifically prompts her to buy them some and she refuses on principle, citing the feeding of the five thousand (??). the orphans claim to be fighters and willing to work for bed and board. Karishna agrees to their terms and also learns that they're Kremish and recommends that they instead recommend giving literally all of their spare money to the church (the baker has previously made a generous donation and is still struggling financially for it). pressed, she says she can take out a loan from various people to give some more.  

Jovian arrives and does a cool trick with his staff to impress the children. he asks the baker for her name. it's Amerento. he asks for some more pastries and then grills Karishna for not paying for any food. Karishna says the children were recruited because they're disposable. the mendicant is visibly disgusted, and lays a charm down next to a loaf of bread. it rises, and continues to rise, growing to the size of half the stall.

Amerento is convinced this miracle is due to her previously giving her bread away for free, as a reward for her kindness, as this is something Karishna had previously mentioned. the mendicant does not want to take credit for this miracle, and allows Karishna to take it. She signs her name over the calligraphy sheet and leaves it on the bread.

child update:
- Morcan has a knife and is at most 14
- Jen has a shortsword and looks a bit sickly but is about 19 probably.
- pretty guarded

---

The party regoups and notes that karishna didn't actually get any rations (just bread) and neither a horse nor cart had been accuired. Jovian heads out to try and find the peddler's paradise. finds some people clearly doing crimes and follow them down a labyrinth of alleyways, underpasses, and tunnels. Find a new symbol, one that [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]] doesn't recognise but is able to identify as the one which leads you to the new location of the market. Jovian takes Astrid there.

it's completely silent, with the merchants gesturing to elaborate diagrams of every possible sort of good. Astrid and Jovian head to a stand with a drawing of a horse (merchant is aulag letorin and knows Jovian from his time as a bandit), and are lead downstairs into a makeshift stable.

Astrid is shown a courser which is either malnourished or atrophied due to its time in the basement. It comes with barding with the emblem scratched off and stained with a dark brown substance, and good quality if worn reigns and so on. She takes the horse partially out of sympathy.

They go to the carriage guy and are offered two - a covered waggon that's a bit beat up, and an ornate gilded carriage previously owned by a weird cult (lord of chains, the shacklesmith, from far southern islands (crown islands). evil in a dad way. maybe exiled giant from grevuldur) that is actively looking for it still. they buy the carriage, and repaint it in white with an inscription on it: "remember in thy days of youth: all is vanity"

---

then we get tired and buy a load of other stuff off screen

---

**Harla 10th of summer**

we head out, get shaken down by some guards. Astrid offers a silver, the guards want more, and everyone else refuses to pay more. a merchant wagon arrives behind us and pressures the guards into letting us pass without paying anything.

we pass Varon's keep, the lighthouse outside Laruna. old seat of a tribe that was later integrated into the Valient empire. a cloud of dust is rising from the far end of the road heading there. Poleman remembers that there's a particularly nasty regiment of the legion stationed there. Astrid considers hiding the carriages off the side of the road.

they stop us and inspect the carriages. ask about the smell, open the seats. there's a hidden compartment underneath. Jovian summons a storm and intimidates them away.

we meet a broken down carriage with a gentry in. Astrid offers their services as a carpenter to them (in exchange for money). Jago tries to pry open the secret compartment with a crowbar when no-one is looking, but fails. Karisna tries to pick the locks, but after some argument agrees to wait until Astrid gets back, as it's their carriage and therefore secret compartment loot.

House Skevantia, prefect in the Mervil marshes area. "necessity is the handmaiden of invention" is their house motto.

Karisma challenges Jago to a duel. the mutually agreed terms are:
- it is to the death
- postpone it until we reach Caldis and the weather is fair
- it is fought using battleaxes
Jago nominates his underling as a champion. He agrees.

the carriage is repaired, 15B is paid. We travel together, stopping just after getting out of the hills as the sun goes down. A watch is negotiated, with a mix of people sleeping inside carriages and around them (the ground is kinda wet from the rain still so it sucks).

**Nashta 10th of Summer**

Jago makes a lovely breakfast for everyone. There's some fish that taste bad because they're from a marsh.
We arrive in [[Caldis]] without event. Karishma unsuccessfully attempts to convince Jen to be her champion. She buys a battleaxe and heads to the field outside of town in which the duel is to be held.

---

A location is picked for the duel. Jago insists on doing it just outside the town wall because it's more scenic.

Karishma goes around asking people if they do poison and eventually a homeless guy leads her to a witch who enchants her axe in exchange for some blood and modifies Father Larinos's bible. She warns that the axe has two blades.

The battle takes place at dusk. Both Karishma and Jago's underling land a direct hit, then Karishma takes another hit, goes down. While bleeding out she throws the axe, but it is parried and falls backwards into her head, killing her instantly.

When the axe is removed, all the blood explodes off, leaving the axe completely clean. Jovian inspects the bible and realises that it's been enchanted to hide some mind altering subliminal messages. Some townsfolk, hearing a commotion, come over, see the body, and wander off saying something about alerting the authorities.

A tiny little innocent young baby child of only 17 years emerges from the crowd, introducing themselves as Gabriel, apprentice blacksmith and creator or Karishma's axe. We send him on a fetch quest to get some shovels and ale and a single iron spike and toss like a bronze at him. Karishma is buried in a shallow grave.

The party wanders off - Gabriel heads to the feast of the willow, the local harvest festival, followed by Polêman and Astrid. Jovian remains by the grave, playing his oud. Jago and underling head back to the inn to rest, apparently dissatisfied with the results of the duel. Athild does something in secret.

Jago is apprehended by the Legion, who followed us to Caldis. They open up the hidden compartments within the carriage, and find a mummified human body and various jars of liquids and other alchemical equipment. Jago is tackled to the floor as Jovian arrives, extingushes all the torches, claims to worship *** the god of chains, and animates some chains to wrap around the Legion commander. They retreat in fear.

Meanwhile at the feast Polêman has a great time and Astrid is kinda grossed out by how everyone is sharing the same food.

All the party's stuff is chucked out onto the street and then loaded onto the carriages, and the party leaves under cover of night for fear of future retaliation from the Legion.

---

**Azuria, 11th of Summer**

The party makes it a little way out of town and rests for the night uneventfully. They continue riding come dawn, and encounter a merchant with a wagon full of chickens in cages (and eggs) who is heading to [[Caldis]] to sell his stuff. He informs the party that the coast to the west is being raided by Marrodic pirates (at least a dozen, likely two). Aethild buys a chicken and uses it to divine the location of the pirates (west by north-west).

Continuing further, we encounter an old battle site and park to have a look around. A group of children are playing with some of the less broken equiptment, but stop as [[Poleman]] and [[Astrid]] approach. Poleman identifies one of the sides based on the location and a half-broken crest (which Astrid takes, aiming to repair) as the army of an old house (Atrait) which previously held land in the marshes, but collapsed around a hundred years ago (the going theory is that were held in favour by the imperial court (and relied on), but fell victim to several land grabs, and while out on a military campaign someone burned down their ancestral home), leaving the soldiers to wander as mercenaries.

Astrid identifies what appears to be a bog body based on a hand raised out of the mud, and calls Poleman and Aethild over to help drag it out. Aethild identifies that this is actually a trap set by an ambush-type monster, but intentionally (and without warning the others) approaches it and grabs the hand anyway. The trap is sprung, and the three fight the monster, with the commotion attracting the attention of several more nearby.

- king with crown (possibly illusion)
- [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]] arrives and tries to part the mud, but it just splashes everywhere
- aethild has the swish hands and tries to use them to counterspell unsuccessfully.
- poleman identifies the venom of the monster as paralytic and captures one alive. it is milked for two tubes of venom, and then killed when it attempts to struggle free.

---

Gang arrives at a roadside inn and stays the night. The priests stay for free in the communal bunk, Aethild and Jago pay for a bunk, and Astrid pays for a lockable room (in which the party valuables are stored).

**Idaia, 11th of Summer**

The next morning it's raining heavily, so we stay in the inn to wait. Astrid overpays for our rooms using a revic silver coin, referencing a tradition of reciprical gift giving. Poleman and Astrid train in a spare room for several hours, watched by the kids at first, but they left after it got much more intense during the second half.

Jago chats up the owner (who is a barmaid?) and they fuck for pretty much the entire day.

At some point, a very wet courier arrives with metal tubes full of paper. He takes out one, but it's been damaged by the rain. Poleman goes over to take a look, and notices it's a wanted poster for [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]]. Aliases include "the mad woodsman", the picture is of a much younger man with wrinkles added, crimes include being a [[Krozin, lord of chains|Krozin]] worshipping mage, and it notes that they are travelling with others in a black caravan.

Poleman attempts to salvage the poster, but the ink runs due to the water and it's only made worse. The courier remarks that he's paid a bronze per poster put up, and that this one was added at the last minute by the Western Legion. 

Poleman attempts to rejoin the Compainions, who are mostly sitting together at another table, but the courier follows him. Identifying Jovian as a priest, he asks if he might perform confession. Jovian accepts, and the two head off to an empty bedroom. Aethild follows stealthily.

The courier confesses that in his hurry to deliver the posters, the rain reducing visibility, and his poor eyesight due to cataracts, his horse ran over something but did not stop. He worries that it was a person. Jovian commands him to find the body and bury it, so that it may be preserved until resurrection. He also offers to try to help the courier's eyes, and successfully does so. Overjoyed, the courier heads back to the road, saying that he will take up another profession upon completing this final job.

Aethild steps outside, attempting to divine how long the rain will last by pissing into it. The wind blows the stream backwards into his face, to the amusement of a woman attempting to divine the same by throwing rocks.

The rain lets up in the evening, but we stay the night since it's a days travel to Mervil Manor. The owner mentions that Lord Mervil accepts all travellers as guests in his manor, something unique amongst the nobility, and that it would be foolish not to accept such hospitatility.

Astrid asks the owner if they have any spare whitewash, which they do, and has them give it to us in exchange for overpaying for the rooms. We whitewash the black caravan, as it is distinctive and known to the authorities. Poleman replaces the calligraphy, now black-on-white.

---

**Beohra, 11th of Summer**

We set off to Mervil Manor with no incidents, arriving in the evening. There appears to be a festival - tables are set out in the grounds, wagons parked around the place, with serving staff moving around from group to group.

A member of staff approaches and asks if we want anything: food, wine, bedding. Jago asks for bedding, and we ask what's going on. the staff member says this is normal and it's always like this, and that it's the wish of the lord to help people wherever possible, then moves on.

We catch another staff member to ask more questions (i forget the exact nature). they say that the lord will be coming out tonight to give a speech, and we should also expect to see his three daughters. they ask if we want to stay in a local inn or inside the manor house (for free, of course), but we say we'll camp near our wagon. the staff member laughs and says that people often do that the first night they stay here.

The party becomes suspicious there's some kind of magic on the grounds making everyone overly pliable and want to stay here (similar to an enchanted forest). Poleman says that no-one can alter his mind if he alters it first, and does a line of mandy.

The daughters (who all look like faeries) arrive and start mingling. We catch one of them and she says that her father is too unwell to give his planned speech, but, noting that we look like the adventurous sort, suggests she might lead us to him. Poleman wants to go but is already drunk off of the free beer, and everyone other than Jovian is too suspicious to enter the manor, so she takes Jovian alone, as a representative for the party.

- lots of magic in the throne room
- lord has a very clearly magic ring on
- lord denies all knowledge of magic (did he say anything about his ancestors or was that a bit? i forget)
- says the land is cursed and sucks and we should find out why, and this has been going on for at least a few months now
- he'll pay 12 silver for any actionable info, and a 60s (plus land/title) for solving the problem entirely
- suggests we start by looking into a single logging village within the swamp which hasn't been abandoned even though all other settlements nearby have been

Astrid gets super freaked out by how everyone who's partaken of the feast wants to move around a lot and not stay with the same group for very long.

We sleep around the caravan. during the night, [[Aggie Wargson]] (a jewler who had traveled with us from the inn) arrives and sleeps next to us.

---

**Talia, 11th of Summer**

[[Aggie Wargson|Aggie]] is described as a "canny acquisitor". She's got an offer of sponsorship from two of the sisters, and might stay in the manor if she can't set up a shop in Duruza. 

[[Rustia Criola de Mervil]] comes up and informs her that her room is ready and she's still on for lunch. She professes to the party that she is an Accorder, and that her father has taken the wrong approach in solving the curse. She offers to fetch a herbalist/cleric who had been thrown out of the manor for voicing his opinion.

The herbalist's name is [[Serego of Matrica]]. Says the curse has been going on for a year, and that coincides with a specific event: the raids on the western coast, Bjarni's Blood Brothers. He asserts that they bring the curse with them, like a plague. 

Curse symptoms (described by various people):
- torrential rains (possibly orod tast magic)
- more monsters in the bog, and disappearances, than usual
- tax
- not enough food
- roads are out, not enough supplies
- all the villages are abandoned

We learn that the bog monsters are bog ghasts, created when travellers in the moors get trapped in the mud and die. it is said they are possessed by bestial spirits of the land, giving them the head of a dog but the cunning of a man. Myths about these are common in the marshes, and sightings are rare but not unheard of.

Aethild asks Serego about potion recipes, and he says he'll compile some for when we get back.

Jovian performs a rite of safe passage so that we may pass through the swamp unhindered. The sloshing mud is turned, at least for those on foot. We cover the carriages to hide them, and leave Jago, his companion, and the children to guard as the rest of us press onwards.

in the town there's a lot of peat diggers, and some work ongoing to repair houses which are slightly askew (falling into the bog maybe). Fine Pete suggests we're not the first people to come here for the lord. Aethild punches him in the face, and they argue for a bit. We go to see the alderman instead. one of the townsfolk shouts that Hirumaya (the current empress) is his favourite god.

the alderman describes the curse as about what we expect, and says it's been going on for at least 7 or 8 months, but some folks say it's been going for longer. He invites us in, and asks us to take our boots off to avoid tracking mud in. He identifies himself as Delcin de Galimari.

He doesn't actually have much more info. Doesn't believe in curses. It's all just a run of bad luck. Metis, the most recently abandoned town, is a special case. It doesn't look like they took their things, there's signs of fighting, and no-one from there has been seen dead or alive. It was mostly abandoned already, though.

Jovian heard that people of Corvinum had been having visions, and asks the Alderman if he can speak to any. He is referred to an old reclusive lady, [[Livia de Vergo]], who the Alderman warns is crazy. She accuses Delcin as having mislead us intentionally. She says the curse is upon Don Mervil and his people, and looking at the land for the source of the curse is therefore fruitless.

She had previously worked for [[Anatona de Mervil]] as a maid. She was kind, but the house had financial troubles. When his wife died, [[Ludovic de Mervil]] set out on a business trip lasting 3 years. He came back with a deal (providing a steady flow of income, source unknown) and a daughter, but was now cold and ruthless. He took charge from his mother, and got put in charge of the finances. A month later, Anatona fell suddenly ill and died, but the Don didn't seem to care. All staff were fired.

Something was going on - carts coming in with stone, going out with dirt (some kind of secret basement? no visible construction works).

The youngest daughter has flowing golden hair, in contrast to the other two. nettie and corly are childhood nicknames for the elder two daughters. toy soldiers, war in the dining room over the dining table. nettie pulled the tablecloth and broke a fine crystal glass.

She says the ring is black, but it's actually yellow. The other details match up, so it seems like the ring changed over time.

Leading theory: the youngest daughter is some kind of demon/vampire, and is either puppeting the don or has similarly corrupted him (with the ring?).

We head to Metis to look for clues. Jovian and Aethild have the ultimate goal of returning to the manor, getting an audience with the ~~archdruid~~ Don, and somehow resolving the curse (via exorcism, cutting off the ring-hand, or just killing him).
