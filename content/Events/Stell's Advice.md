loyalists:
- very secure in their duty for Varnoss who they view as the protectors of the old ways
- extremely traditionalist
- defends tradition to the death
- uthrun holds a lot of sway within the old
	- old servants and a number of shieldbearer families
	- controls the treasury
- lacks power in the marches and the city
- varnish has little interest in the conflict
- uthrun has all but proclaimed herself jarl, but does not control the land or the vast majorities of the huscarl families and a large number of the military
- doesn't care about the will
- if you can get the support of the huskal families (the electors) uthrun would have to yield

Hrodi and Hrafni:
- something about Varnoss?
- wish to steer clear of the conflict
- differ in religion which symbolises unity between religion
- pragmatists
- need to change and prepare to survive the oncoming calamity
- supported by the vast majority of the military
- need to deliver the news of Brago's death yourself
	- because Hrafni is Brago's mother
	- she might side with you in a pragmatic fashion
- likely to support the will or at least pretend to do so
- if the will supported them they'd probably move onto the hold, threatening to fight
- likely to be inconstantant, vying for their own advantage
- likely some way to use intrigue to turn them against each other, which would make their position very weak

Brago:
- had fantasies about finding a middle way between the two
- had little support, only amongst the youngest clan members

Secret third option:
- because Astrid kissed the ring, the loyalists might view that as Varnoss taking a side
- if you get close with Ranvig, maybe travel back on her boat...
	- would need to show that you've gained Varnoss' favour
- would have to commit to this path absolutely

- watch out carefully for some of the other jarl's friends. some were close with Brago, and will be upset even if they believe the duel was fair and honourable.
