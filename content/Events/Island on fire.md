and a current cast list:
The Marsallas'
- Tibreta [[Thracio]] Mimori, Duke Consort
- Njall Hrafna, Marsallas family confessor
- [[Lassrin]] sar Shuvesh, Marsallas retinue member and bodyguard

The Nivish Party
- Dimia Innocenta della Juno, young scholar and heiress of the della Juno estate
- Vitaly Von Brom, cheery rogue and strongman with limited grasp on the language
- [[Nihaya Nadhirtan]], elderly courtier and scribe for the della Junos
- Caeso, scrupulous manservant for Innocenta

The Crew
- Olag Aksen, neurotic and dour barber-surgeon
- [[Karishna]] Mazdoor, silvertongued priestess for the underserved minorities of the empire
- [[Satara]] Tatian, grizzled and suspicious former bluecoat inquisitor
- [[Pellam]] del Runi, cheery older labourer fallen on hard times
- Elzibet sil Acan, Accorder zealot and battlescarred merc from the Carmine Isles
	- huge fan of Karishna


The party got together (presumably in the tavern we later meet in) and elected Innocenta as the leader on the grounds that they're rich and pretty smart and charismatic. Karishna was also a contender but only got one vote (from herself).

Satara interviewed everyone and made notes in a little book about how everyone was suspicious, but also seemed kinda disaffected. 

Nihaya convinced Innocenta to organise a "get hammered" event before going to the dig site.

several other character interactions which didn't involve me occurred.

---

- meet in tavern in Luruna one-by-one
	- everything is on the house, presumably paid for by the Marsallas
	- it's a pretty quiet place, only a couple of locals
- all sit down clockwise around the table
- play cards (knights and knaves)
	- Innocenta adds a gold to the first round's pot, which eventually goes to Vitaly Von Brom
	- Satara is visibly upset at both losing and not gaining any dirt on anyone
- The Marsallas arrive and conduct some interviews
	- general labourers are taken upstairs to talk, mercs engage in a dual with Lassrin
	- Satara is disarmed, but disarms their opponent at the same time
		- Nihaya recognises this as a binding spell by seeing the link between the two objects
			- isn't super familiar with the spell/school but this was a kind of magic seraphites were often accused of/persecuted for
	- Vitaly attempts to fight Lassrin, hoping for a merc's pay, but this only angers him
	- Karishna threatens to walk unless she gets 4S/w
- Everyone sleeps in the tavern (all the rooms had been booked out for us)
- Ride to Marsallo
	- Satara, Karishna and Elzibet walk
	- as we pass Ventasa all the locals go inside and are quiet (afraid?)
		- a child (angry?) motions to throw a rock at the carriage but is tacked by their parents and dragged inside
	- Some goats are on the road
		- their owner hears the carriages and tries to move them
			- upon seeing the emblems they dive into the bushes in fear
		- [[Thracio]] (?) says something along the lines of "kill the goats [...] we can deal with them on our way back"
			- they later clarify that since they appeared untended and were on their property, they had the right to slaughter them
		- Karishna herds the goats off the road before they are killed
- we're put up in tents just outside the estate "as a simulation of what it'd be like at the dig site"
	- The Marsallas immediately hurry home as it's getting dark
	- [[Thracio]] asks Karishna to look after his daughter, [[Diada]] (who refuses to take a large number of guards along)
	- Karishna borrows a horse and rides around the local area
		- literally no-one is outside (you would expect to see foragers)
		- she knocks on the door of a random house and they're scared shitless
	- Pellam tells us about a group of bandits (lonely eye band) operating in the area
		- based off Golden Hoof mercs (cavalry band from Ashan, worked for Valient army)
		- they took over an Fort Lonely Eye, their leader alleges they were promised the title of marchioness during the war and therefore have the right to it. pretty much just extorts everyone in the general area
		- usually they operate in the south so it's notable (but not totally unsurprising) to see people flying their insignia this far north

---

- Olag scrys a bad omen related to tooth
- all the workers making tents presentable
- cook (treon) making food for arrival of nobles at noon
- earlier than expected (shortly after 9) noble carriage pulls up with [[Diada]], Lassrin, and one other (othor, manservant)
- she enthusiastically lays out some artifacts on a table. 
	- they apparently come from a large (!) undisturbed (!!) underground city recently exposed by an earthquake
	- Satara is visibly disturbed by the idea of earthquakes destroying a village
	- some identified as coins which can be used as lodestones to form larger sheets. extremely old
	- cool double bladed swords with a spring-loaded mechanism which slashes the blades together (slightly crossed over)
	- large triangular gem ending in a blue semicircle with a diamond shaped hole in the middle
		- if you know what to look for (you don't) it has a slight magical aura
		- no-one was allowed to touch it
	- several perfect pots (no signs of workmanship) one of which appears to contain rotting straw
		- used by villagers as it keeps mice/rats out?
	- several chunks of stock with mosaics on them, some tiles have multiple colours on them
		- they appear to have been repainted
	- she's gonna open up a exhibition hall with all this stuff in
	- tentatively named the city Tugendrac (after the city of the same name in accorder scripture), as it was buried by a volcano (or something like that?)
	- she says there's a/some monsters around maybe
		- furrows her brow at "oh is that why no-one comes out at night" but quickly moves on
		- great cobra? large spider? crayfish??
- people have been leaving the area for about 10 years now but the last lot left around the start of the year
- there's suspiciously gigantic corn/wheat in otherwise overgrown and abandoned fields
- cross at a shallow part of the river but have to leave the carriages behind
	- horses are able to ford
- hags' hat flies off in the wind; a shoal of fish (?) are spotted and people freak out about that. metalic clang; sharp teeth on a black fish body with no scales (and no visible eyes). a worker tries to climb up onto a raft but is pulled down and devoured.
- rafts start to float away, one is picked up by boat. Satara gets back in the water to pull the other but sees a body in the water (days old, half eaten, peasant worker). panics and runs to shore.
	- Satara gets called back before getting very far and comes to help take the remaining raft back. heroically keeps going even while the fish were biting at her legs.
	- [[Ingi]], a worker, gets several fish bite into his arm. Nihaya calls out to raise his arm out of the water, and the fish quickly dry up and smoulder with a cold blue flame before falling off.
		- this is later interpreted as divine intervention
- all supplies and all but two workers made it across safely. two suffered major injuries, with many suffering minor bites.
	- one horse died (diada's pony) and the other three didn't cross
- scouting finds a house with axe marks on the door, arrowheads in the wall, and a splash of brown blood (likely weeks old)
	- recent-ish (this year?) repairs to the village sanctuary
	- bad vibes
- Innocenta eats one of the fishes and everyone is grossed out

---

- othor and innocentia's manservernt go home with some horses
- division of labour: 
	- hunting party (obtain game to supplement rations)
	- people who stay at camp (guards, chef, gathering firewood, preparing lumber)
	- excavation crew (digging/installing struts in the ruins)
	- exploration crew (dungeon crawling)
- everyone gets relevant tools from the stash
- down 40m into a ravine, suddenly becomes extremely deep
	- a lantern is lowered 50m down by rope and it keeps going
		- briefly became taut, rope is now frayed about 0.5m above where the lantern used to be tied
			- did something eat it????
	- rock takes about 8s so somewhere between 200-300m
	- two recently constructed rope bridges allow easy passage into the entrance
	- big fancy basalt wall curves towards us
		- ornamental columns lighter rock looks like snakes (or maybe twine)
		- big mural, middle is ruined (both from weathering and chipping)
			- night sky; stars showing constellations
			- snaking and tendriled creatures; one is wrapped around the sun
			- seems to be a re-interpretation of the constellations, some of them are in a bit of a different place than usual
	- pair of double doors made of brass
		- one is damaged with a big crack
			- looks worse than weather alone could have, there's specific discernable blows
		- reinforced with more sheets of brass on the inside
- large room, over 2m tall
	- ancient weathered statues utilised as columns, supporting roof
		- robes like ball gowns, but no clear features; almost worn smooth
	- walls angled away from the doors
	- tatues and columns on the right collaplsed, little caved in
	- mosaic on the floor but mostly balck and white
		- laquer on the floor preserves it suprisingly well
- 3m long corridoor hexagonal tiles, can't go further bc the roof is caved in
	- corpse with only a hand poking out wearing a bracelet
		- looks about a week old which implies grave robbers
- prominade 5-10m windy. floor has spherical and diamond patterns
	- half curved sphere of brass and glass has fallen from above and crushed the steet
	- buildings on the sides, looks like orderly city streets. some colapsed.
		- wooden doors are rotting
	- rear wall cemicirclurar groove with brass pipes (idk what those are). similar pipes are on cealings of most roads
- wooden door propped against a wall with no hinges. eye painted in red. next to it is some rubble
	- looks like it was taken from a nearby building and has been recently put here to shut 
		- inside the house it was taken from is a mural of a flower field below a starlit sky
		- there's a figure but they appear to have been defaced (narually or deliberately)
			- gap behind the crack, there's something on the other side (sound of dripping water, lichen on the inside, humid)
	- we clear the rubble propping the door up, satara looks inside and a hoard of bats fly out. there's a nasty stench (rotting meat)
	- horrible horrible tiny tunnel im so claustraphobic
	- pile of bones polished clean and loads around the room
	- green light which is bats glowing green
		- it's otherwise a normal fruit bat
		- its blood and fluids are the glowing parts
eel thing with chitinous hide; at least 3x2 legs responds to sound and is mostly silent (and blind?).
flesh peels back in the shape of a chitinous eye. instead of pupil there's a swirling mass of undulating green casting a cone of light.

missing session

---

vitali jumps into the hole
more cave, tattered remains of corpses
eggs which never hatched
innocenta is extremely aware of her surroundings
vitali is yelling and coming towards her
sees hole going further down, and (in a different room) innocenta on her own

many things happen

it's called the memserworm

down the hole, left, bear right
weird pile of lacquered rocks
some pipes on the bug hole
rent, sound of rushing water. behind it on the left trail of black blood (from the bug?)
in the other path there's the faint glow of magma (on the second left)
straight ahead: portcullis 
we follow the memserwurm's blood trail down a narrow passage, a humanoid lunges towards satara (and trips over) and from behind us a two bows are fired

cut to innocenta who is in the camp, it is being raided by bandits (not from yrah?)

---

- party attempts to calm everyone down by insisting that we're chill and not really that associated with the marcellas actually (even though olag previously shouted something indicating we were)
- everyone other than an insane woman with a helmet and a mace agree to a ceacefire, mace person (i cant remember her name it was something like margret) takes a swing and is then calmed down by her friends
	- she says something about needing to get the seeds and open the portcullis
	- is obviously controlled by the siren and/or the mace
	- the villagers say they really want to see the sun but also there's several more in some kind of camp further in and they need to go and retrieve them. the party is against this because they're suspicious they are also controlled by the siren
- nihaya sees the mace is magic and goes to take a look. brushes hand against it, has a vision of power, and really really wants to take it now
- olag comes up and attempts to wrestle the mace out of mace woman's hands, fails, turns off the lantern and attacks nihaya, fails, and is then knocked out by mace woman. nihaya backsteps into the darkness
- mace woman then attempts to attack satara, who disarms her and stands over the mace to prevent anyone picking it up
- everyone is kind of spooked, and mace woman is visibly distressed. we arrive at an impasse where satara won't let the mace be picked back up, but the villagers refuse to leave without it
- unprompted, karishna dives towards the mace, and is kicked away. mace woman retrieves the mace during the distraction and attempts to run away, but is consumed by blue fire and drops it
- the villagers resume combat, two are killed and two more escape
- big argument over whether we should (a) keep the mace, (b) study and subsequently destroy it, or (c) immediately destroy it. eventually it's put in a bag and given to olag to carry out to the surface
- while leaving, olag cuts the rope we were climbing to get out of a pit, leaving only him and satara at the top. they pretend there's a monster that cut the rope and then run off
- nihaya chases them and catches up as they reach the entrance to the ruins, and sees olag drop the mace into the giant chasm (what the hell dude)
- nihaya and satara split off from the rest of the party (who are immediately returning to camp) to go see how diada is progressing with the dig. it's going well! they've excavated up to the doors of the big chamber but dont want to open them yet until tomorrow just in case
- the rest of the party meet with innocenta, who says calmly "the camp is taken over by bandits drop your weapons and provide no resistance". karishna, unprompted, puts her dagger up to innocentas throat. a bandit appears and says "hey dont do that that's not gonna make me kill you any less" and karishna somehow de-escalates the situation and sulks in the corner reading scripture out loud. no-one else offers any resistance.

---

- nihaya and satara hang back from the rest of the digging crew talking as everyone heads back to the camp. the group is stopped by the entrance, and they overhear [[Lassrin]] say something like "i think we're gonna have to kill this guy steven" (it involved arrows and could be contrued as "lets kill nihaya and satara" if you tried really hard to misinterpret it) (he was talking about the bandits). they flee back into the ruins, not having really been noticed by anyone
- everyone else offers no resistance and are tied up by the bandits. the head bandit goes arround intimidating everyone and then stabbing them if he doesn't like them. olag is about to get stabbed, but dodges and then stabs himself to assert dominance. this succeeds and he patches himself up again. two npcs die: karisha's friend and one of the labourers
- in the morning, he gets vitali (who inists on taking innocenta), olag, and a very beat up lassrin to go down into the ruins to take the heads of nihata and satara, offering not-death to anyone who brings back a head (other than innocenta who is just there for moral support)
- meanwhile, nihaya is confronted about obviously being a mage by satara. nihaya explains her interpretation of magic and it drives satara insane and she runs away, having become obsessed with and simultaneously afraid of the concept of power. the two later make up and head into the big room that the digging crew planned to enter the following day.
- the room is a large octagon, with a tiled floor, pillars around the edges supporting a balcony which have several doors on. part of the area to the right is collapsed, and there is a passageway leading out on the right and a staircase to the balcony on the left. there is a valve just within reach above the entrance
- satara doesn't want to turn the valve and leaves, allowing nihaya to turn it on her own. it causes sunlight water to flow into a huge transparent gem covering the entire ceiling (we really don't know what glass is huh), lighting up the entire room. satara hears something skitter away as the room is lit up.
	- the water appears to be flowing upwards, which is weird and confusing.
- nihaya turns the valve again and all the water flows backwards, also confusingly. the room is dark again. she then turns the valve on again and the room lights up once more. satara hears the clicking again and then it's a big monster on the ceiling (see [[conversation with the construct]])
