minor god from [[The Carmine Isles]]. Has something to do with slavery (probably pro slavery given the name). Worshippers are broadly considered cultists, at least outside of the isles.

Thought to have been a giant (or maybe still is?).

A wagon previously belonging to Krozin cultists (containing a mummified human, spices (to cover up the smell) and alchemy equipment in a hidden compartment under the seats) was purchased by the [[Companions of Knut]] in [[Luruna]].
