minor god from [[The Carmine Isles]]. Has something to do with slavery (probably pro slavery given the name). Worshippers are broadly considered cultists, at least outside of the isles. Isle of Madan, city of Kroz. Happened about 200 years ago.

Thought to have been an obsidian giant.

A wagon previously belonging to Krozin cultists (containing a mummified human, spices (to cover up the smell) and alchemy equipment in a hidden compartment under the seats) was purchased by the [[Companions of Knut]] in [[Luruna]].
