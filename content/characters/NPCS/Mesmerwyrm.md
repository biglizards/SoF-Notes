Reminiscent of a 3-5m long eel, but with 6 thin legs. Feet sharp (like blades). Blind, but acute hearing. Has a large sac filled with bioluminecent green liquid on its underbelly, usually covered by opaque flesh which the monster can peel back, like an eyelid. Seeing the light emitted by this liquid puts animals into a state of hypnosis, causing them to remain still.

Capable of injecting a paralytic venom into its victims, mothers will carry live prey into their warrens to teach their young how to hunt. The venom heals the wounds inflicted in battle, perhaps to give them a sporting chance. Since they cannot see, the hunt begins only when the venom begins to wear off and the prey starts to move around again. While Mesmerwyrms are immune to the paralytic effects, they can use their venom to heal each other.
