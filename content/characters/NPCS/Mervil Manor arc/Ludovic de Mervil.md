Current duke of the Mervil Marshes. Son of [[Anatona de Mervil]]. Has three daughters:
- [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] (eldest)
- [[Rustia Criola de Mervil]] 
- [[Aulani Lavinia de Mervil]] (yongest)

When his wife, Rustia, died, he set out on a buisness trip to [[The Carmine Isles]] aiming to use his connections to help the family finances, which had declined considerably along with the empire in general. He returened successful, with a deal providing continuous income, as well as a daughter: [[Aulani Lavinia de Mervil]]. Following this success, he became head of the house, as well as its finances. A month later, his mother fell ill and died, though he is reported to not have been emotionally affected by this. He then fired all staff and began construction of something (presumably a basement) in secret.

In 172AL he started asking for help with a curse on his land, offering 12 silver for any actionable information, and a 60s (plus land and a title) for solving the problem entirely. Around this time, reports of heavier-than-usual rain, increased bog ghast sightings and disappearances, and settlements within the marshes being abandoned sharply increased.

He has a reputation for hosting travellers on his estate both indiscriminately and free of charge, either in an on-site inn, on the grounds, or within the manor (such as in the ballroom).

He wears an ornate magic ring with a large jewel. When observed by [[Livia de Vergo]] (around the time he returned from his trip, presumably at least 10 years ago) the jewel was black, but when observed by [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]] in 172AL it had become yellow.

When visited by Jovian, a magical aura permeated the throne room, although Ludovic denied all knowledge of magic when questioned.

He's in his 40s.
