Seemingly unimportant worker on the dig. Was pulling a raft of supplies when attacked by carnivorous fish. Nihaya ordered him to raise his arm (where the fish were attacking) out of the water, and then smote the fish.

This was brought up in the evening with [[Satara]] and [[Nihaya Nadhirtan|Nihaya]]. Satara suggested it may have been caused by divine intervention (although she did not believe this herself).
