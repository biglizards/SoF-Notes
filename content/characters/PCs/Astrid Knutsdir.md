Full name: Astrid Knutsdir of Clan Virkvärg.
Age: 51 (born in 121 AL)

Backstory:
Astrid was born to Revic parents in the Varlish town of Morala (the same town where [[Poleman]] was later born). At a young age, during a Marodic raid of the town, she was adopted by the Jarl Knut of Clan Virkvärg and whisked away to the Marolaw.

She spent the next years training as a Shieldbearer in the Virkvärgvakt ('Timberwolfguard'), eventually becoming extremely proficient in horse archery. She participated in a campaign during the Third Valiant-Marodic War, including the Siege of Limis at the age of 24. Notably, in this battle she fought on the opposite side as [[Satara Tatian]].

She settled down in her new country, climbing military ranks and taking an apprenticeship in woodworking, until in her late 30s she became a Thane in her Clan and was able to bring her aging parents over to the Marolaw. There, they live in her townhouse near to Varnoss, alongside Astrid's own wife and adopted child.

Character notes:
- Much to Poleman's chagrin, she is more interested in going home to her family than in partaking in the oh-so-exciting QUEST

Brought Knut's reliquary from Luruna to the Virkvärg clanhold in Varnoss during the events of [[Companions of Knut]] and [[Companions of Knutsdir]]. Knut's will named her Jarl, splitting the already divided clan even further. She is currently in hiding, slowly gathering political support.
