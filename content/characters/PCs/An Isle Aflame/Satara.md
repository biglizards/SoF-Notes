Satara Tatian, grizzled and suspicious former bluecoat inquisiton

- at some point caused an avalanche using magic, killing several inquisitors (friends?)
- always carries an umbral steel sword with her for fear of doing it again

Has a strange rapport with [[Nihaya Nadhirtan|Nihaya]] relating to magic:
- she is aware Nihaya is affected mentally by the umbral sword
- appears suspicious about what happened to [[Ingi]], but has made no accusations
