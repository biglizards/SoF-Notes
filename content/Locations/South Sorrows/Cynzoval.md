quarry up against the mountain range east of the weeping pass, but no through route to the ester woods.

current population is 40, but could house 300. Seems especially ravaged by the [[False Moon Spire|False Moon]].

Has enough food to last the winter of 172, but not enough population to properly function come the spring.
