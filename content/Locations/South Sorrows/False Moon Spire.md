The False Moon is a object of folklore within the South Sorrows. The False Moon Spire, named after the former, is an Attavan tower partially embedded in a cliff face forming the Thunder Mountains.

## The False Moon

The False Moon sometimes appears in the dreams of those within the South Sorrows. It typically appears as a second moon in the sky, made of gold, a few hundred metres in the air within the Thunder Mountains (the same location of the False Moon Spire).
 
## The False Moon Spire

The False Moon Spire is a tower of smooth black stone. It was discovered a few years ago (WHEN?) by locals from [[Moli]]. It is known to be of Atavan design.

The outside of the tower appears to be constructed from continuous solid stone, with no visible brickwork, doors, or windows. It is conjectured that it may be possible to enter the tower through a nearby cave system leading to the back of the tower, or that an entrance may appear during a full moon.

At night, a solid, bright green glow can be seen coming from the tower.

A group of scholars, escorted by legionaries, were dispatched from the university of Murga (WHEN?) (two seasons ago, in spring?). They were brought to the tower by a local from Moli, who returned two weeks later (on their request) to bring supplies, and found that they had disappeared without a trace.

The mountains surrounding the tower were described by Tibretto as though they had been hewn by giants, although this is not abnormal for mountains.
### Psychic Effects

The tower, or something within, seems capable of entering the dreams of those within its line of sight, and convincing them that something they desire can be found in the tower, causing them to leave their homes during the night. Some people have been stopped while leaving and asked where they are going and why:

- people from [[Cynzoval]] report those leaving say they expect to find a better life by the tower
- people from [[Fonsano]] report those leaving say they're trying to track down lost livestock (which previously departed towards the tower days prior)

People from Moli report no disappearances, and are on the other side of a mountain range from the tower. Cynzoval, in direct line of sight and reasonably close, has lost 80% of its population, Fonsano, somewhat obscured but at a similar distance, reports around 20% of losses, and [[Arx Dalorans]] (obscured and further away) have seen few losses at all (potentially only one). It is conjectured based on this that the effect only functions on those within line of sight of the tower, and that potentially the green glowing light itself causes this effect, similar to that of the [[Mesmerwyrm]].

The strength of this psychic effect appears to scale with the fullness of the moon, affecting primarily animals during waxing, and the majority of human disappearances occur during the full moon.

### In folklore

The spire is said to be a lighthouse operated by (TODO), a god from the old Yrric pantheon representing (TODO). The light supposedly guides the souls of the dead to their final resting place, and the land the light touches is reserved for the dead and should be left uninhabited.

unanswered questions:
- is the black stone of the tower local to the area? could it have been carved out of the mountains?
- how tall is the tower?
- how do you get inside?
- why are people (and animals) continually drawn to the tower?
	- what happens to them causing them to disapear?
- why does the psychic effect get stronger during a full moon?
- when exactly was the tower discovered?
- how is it a subject of local folklore (a lighthouse) if it was only recently discovered?
- how do they know it's of Atavan make?
