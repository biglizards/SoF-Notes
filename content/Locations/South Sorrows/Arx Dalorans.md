Primary fortification and seat of power for the South Sorrows. Constructed haphazardly in layers, there is a tower and relatively low-lying fort surrounding it.

Currently occupied by the Prefect of the South Sorrows, with a garrison force of 750 legionaries.

## History

The Arx Dalorans was originally constructed as a watchtower to keep an eye on the weeping pass. During the Nivish war of independence, the Nivs lay seige to Castle Mourn, incorrectly believing that they would be able to take it before the Empire's army was able to navigate through the volcanic landscape to reach them. 

They were forced to retreat to the other side of the weeping pass, where the Arx was the only fortified structure, and hastily expanded it with all required functions and additional fortification.
