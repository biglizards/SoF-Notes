Logging town by sotton grove, fortification made of wood (population 200). Nominally controlled by the Logging Lodge, but all officiaries were killed during a peasant uprising lead by a band of deserters.

## History

While in control of the town, the Logging Lodge had a poor reputation with the local townsfolk.

Throughout 172AL, there were reports of deserters occupying the woods, attacking travels and lightly raiding the town. 6 Legionaries were dispatched from [[Arx Dalorans]], although they seemed poorly received by the townsfolk as well.

The lodge paid off the deserters with lumber, and the attacks stopped. Having lulled them into a false sense of security, the deserters entered the town and slaughtered the lodge officials (which the peasants were happy with and even participated in).

The townsfolk armed themselves and established a militia of around 40 men and defences with the aim of demanding better treatment from the Prefect (no taxes, they collect tarrifs on wood, etc) come the spring. Some of their houses were partially disassembled to make fortifications.

Around 50 townsfolk have gone missing due to the [[False Moon Spire|False Moon]], looking either for lost livestock or the townsfolk who had previously gone missing.
