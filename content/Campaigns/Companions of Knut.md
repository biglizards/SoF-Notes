[[Jovian Palantina]] - the mendicant
Aethild - the baneman
Jago and Juevo

**Mara 10th of summer**

Keybearer elected - it's Astrid Knutsdir. A wax seal is placed over the keyhole bearing the seal of the three corners sanctuary.

We compile a shopping list, and then head out to find the goods:
- poleman is getting a lockbox for party valuables
- aethild and astrid are getting a horse and a cart
- jovian and karisma are getting food, water, and feed

[[Poleman]] heads to the temple to ask around and see what locksmith they use. Runs into Dimion Corbulo - mandy dealer and street fighting ring participant. Poleman buys a month's worth and tries a bit - it's stronger than usual.

He heads through the recently installed golden doors of the church, past the three monkeys. asks for markos, the guy in charge, and finds him in his office. Asks where to find a locksmith, and markos sings about "rudeous fox, down by the docks". Poleman moves to leave, hits his head on the doors and falls down.

Slightly more sober, he mentions TERSIUS fox and that was actually a guy who wrote a book called "on the applications of tallow in cartography". Markos gives me a map and tells me that actually sister helva knows where i can find the locksmith. I ask her and get referred to rusen's locks.

The locksmith is out on buisness, but her husband is still there and sells a chest for 2s and gives poleman a haircut for 5c.

Someone threw a chamber pot on a passing noble (don creso, presumably by mistake). Aethild suggested that they should consume the urine of the chamber pot's owner else get dysentery. The noble, identifying the baneman as a "problem solver" sends them into their house. They meet a woman (hilda, maid?) who identifies the chamberpot's owner as lusenna, who has been locked in her room on account of madness. Heads up the stairs and meets cpl Klaus, wielding an improvised weapon. Aethild offers his services and it's seemingly accepted.

talking to Tommy toggles came threw window told her pot of gold had been placed on the roof. knicker knacker put down oil causing her to slip (she gestures at dry floor boards). 

"watch yourself longfingers has you by the shoulder"

Aethild gets some piss from Lusenna and adds it into the sweetbread mix being prepared by Hilda.

Astrid gets talking with the noble and mentions looking for a courser. the noble is trying to push some performance enhancing drugs and recommends a specific stable (peddler's paradise). i think something else shady happened too?? i wasn't paying attention. offers a horse/cart for some kind of service? seems plausible

Aethild forces the noble to eat the sweetbread (witchcake), he complains it's weirdly bitter and sweet.

---

[[Karishna]] goes to the baker to get some rations. there's some orphans begging for bread and the baker specifically prompts her to buy them some and she refuses on principle, citing the feeding of the five thousand (??). the orphans claim to be fighters and willing to work for bed and board. Karishna agrees to their terms and also learns that they're Kremish and recommends that they instead recommend giving literally all of their spare money to the church (the baker has previously made a generous donation and is still struggling financially for it). pressed, she says she can take out a loan from various people to give some more.  

Jovian arrives and does a cool trick with his staff to impress the children. he asks the baker for her name. it's Amerento. he asks for some more pastries and then grills Karishna for not paying for any food. Karishna says the children were recruited because they're disposable. the mendicant is visibly disgusted, and lays a charm down next to a loaf of bread. it rises, and continues to rise, growing to the size of half the stall.

Amerento is convinced this miracle is due to her previously giving her bread away for free, as a reward for her kindness, as this is something Karishna had previously mentioned. the mendicant does not want to take credit for this miracle, and allows Karishna to take it. She signs her name over the calligraphy sheet and leaves it on the bread.

child update:
- Morcan has a knife and is at most 14
- Jen has a shortsword and looks a bit sickly but is about 19 probably.
- pretty guarded

---

The party regoups and notes that karishna didn't actually get any rations (just bread) and neither a horse nor cart had been accuired. Jovian heads out to try and find the peddler's paradise. finds some people clearly doing crimes and follow them down a labyrinth of alleyways, underpasses, and tunnels. Find a new symbol, one that [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]] doesn't recognise but is able to identify as the one which leads you to the new location of the market. Jovian takes Astrid there.

it's completely silent, with the merchants gesturing to elaborate diagrams of every possible sort of good. Astrid and Jovian head to a stand with a drawing of a horse (merchant is aulag letorin and knows Jovian from his time as a bandit), and are lead downstairs into a makeshift stable.

Astrid is shown a courser which is either malnourished or atrophied due to its time in the basement. It comes with barding with the emblem scratched off and stained with a dark brown substance, and good quality if worn reigns and so on. She takes the horse partially out of sympathy.

They go to the carriage guy and are offered two - a covered waggon that's a bit beat up, and an ornate gilded carriage previously owned by a weird cult (lord of chains, the shacklesmith, from far southern islands (crown islands). evil in a dad way. maybe exiled giant from grevuldur) that is actively looking for it still. they buy the carriage, and repaint it in white with an inscription on it: "remember in thy days of youth: all is vanity"

---

then we get tired and buy a load of other stuff off screen

---

**Harla 10th of summer**

we head out, get shaken down by some guards. Astrid offers a silver, the guards want more, and everyone else refuses to pay more. a merchant wagon arrives behind us and pressures the guards into letting us pass without paying anything.

we pass Varon's keep, the lighthouse outside Laruna. old seat of a tribe that was later integrated into the Valient empire. a cloud of dust is rising from the far end of the road heading there. Poleman remembers that there's a particularly nasty regiment of the legion stationed there. Astrid considers hiding the carriages off the side of the road.

they stop us and inspect the carriages. ask about the smell, open the seats. there's a hidden compartment underneath. Jovian summons a storm and intimidates them away.

we meet a broken down carriage with a gentry in. Astrid offers their services as a carpenter to them (in exchange for money). Jago tries to pry open the secret compartment with a crowbar when no-one is looking, but fails. Karisna tries to pick the locks, but after some argument agrees to wait until Astrid gets back, as it's their carriage and therefore secret compartment loot.

House Skevantia, prefect in the Mervil marshes area. "necessity is the handmaiden of invention" is their house motto.

Karisma challenges Jago to a duel. the mutually agreed terms are:
- it is to the death
- postpone it until we reach Caldis and the weather is fair
- it is fought using battleaxes
Jago nominates his underling as a champion. He agrees.

the carriage is repaired, 15B is paid. We travel together, stopping just after getting out of the hills as the sun goes down. A watch is negotiated, with a mix of people sleeping inside carriages and around them (the ground is kinda wet from the rain still so it sucks).

**Nashta 10th of Summer**

Jago makes a lovely breakfast for everyone. There's some fish that taste bad because they're from a marsh.
We arrive in [[Caldis]] without event. Karishma unsuccessfully attempts to convince Jen to be her champion. She buys a battleaxe and heads to the field outside of town in which the duel is to be held.

---

A location is picked for the duel. Jago insists on doing it just outside the town wall because it's more scenic.

Karishma goes around asking people if they do poison and eventually a homeless guy leads her to a witch who enchants her axe in exchange for some blood and modifies Father Larinos's bible. She warns that the axe has two blades.

The battle takes place at dusk. Both Karishma and Jago's underling land a direct hit, then Karishma takes another hit, goes down. While bleeding out she throws the axe, but it is parried and falls backwards into her head, killing her instantly.

When the axe is removed, all the blood explodes off, leaving the axe completely clean. Jovian inspects the bible and realises that it's been enchanted to hide some mind altering subliminal messages. Some townsfolk, hearing a commotion, come over, see the body, and wander off saying something about alerting the authorities.

A tiny little innocent young baby child of only 17 years emerges from the crowd, introducing themselves as Gabriel, apprentice blacksmith and creator or Karishma's axe. We send him on a fetch quest to get some shovels and ale and a single iron spike and toss like a bronze at him. Karishma is buried in a shallow grave.

The party wanders off - Gabriel heads to the feast of the willow, the local harvest festival, followed by PolÃªman and Astrid. Jovian remains by the grave, playing his oud. Jago and underling head back to the inn to rest, apparently dissatisfied with the results of the duel. Athild does something in secret.

Jago is apprehended by the Legion, who followed us to Caldis. They open up the hidden compartments within the carriage, and find a mummified human body and various jars of liquids and other alchemical equipment. Jago is tackled to the floor as Jovian arrives, extingushes all the torches, claims to worship [[Krozin, lord of chains]] the god of chains, and animates some chains to wrap around the Legion commander. They retreat in fear.

Meanwhile at the feast PolÃªman has a great time and Astrid is kinda grossed out by how everyone is sharing the same food.

All the party's stuff is chucked out onto the street and then loaded onto the carriages, and the party leaves under cover of night for fear of future retaliation from the Legion.

---

**Azuria, 11th of Summer**

The party makes it a little way out of town and rests for the night uneventfully. They continue riding come dawn, and encounter a merchant with a wagon full of chickens in cages (and eggs) who is heading to [[Caldis]] to sell his stuff. He informs the party that the coast to the west is being raided by Marrodic pirates (at least a dozen, likely two). Aethild buys a chicken and uses it to divine the location of the pirates (west by north-west).

Continuing further, we encounter an old battle site and park to have a look around. A group of children are playing with some of the less broken equiptment, but stop as [[Poleman]] and [[Astrid]] approach. Poleman identifies one of the sides based on the location and a half-broken crest (which Astrid takes, aiming to repair) as the army of an old house (Atrait) which previously held land in the marshes, but collapsed around a hundred years ago (the going theory is that were held in favour by the imperial court (and relied on), but fell victim to several land grabs, and while out on a military campaign someone burned down their ancestral home), leaving the soldiers to wander as mercenaries.

Astrid identifies what appears to be a bog body based on a hand raised out of the mud, and calls Poleman and Aethild over to help drag it out. Aethild identifies that this is actually a trap set by an ambush-type monster, but intentionally (and without warning the others) approaches it and grabs the hand anyway. The trap is sprung, and the three fight the monster, with the commotion attracting the attention of several more nearby.

- king with crown (possibly illusion)
- [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]] arrives and tries to part the mud, but it just splashes everywhere
- aethild has the swish hands and tries to use them to counterspell unsuccessfully.
- poleman identifies the venom of the monster as paralytic and captures one alive. it is milked for two tubes of venom, and then killed when it attempts to struggle free.

---

Gang arrives at a roadside inn and stays the night. The priests stay for free in the communal bunk, Aethild and Jago pay for a bunk, and Astrid pays for a lockable room (in which the party valuables are stored).

**Idaia, 11th of Summer**

The next morning it's raining heavily, so we stay in the inn to wait. Astrid overpays for our rooms using a revic silver coin, referencing a tradition of reciprical gift giving. Poleman and Astrid train in a spare room for several hours, watched by the kids at first, but they left after it got much more intense during the second half.

Jago chats up the owner (who is a barmaid?) and they fuck for pretty much the entire day.

At some point, a very wet courier arrives with metal tubes full of paper. He takes out one, but it's been damaged by the rain. Poleman goes over to take a look, and notices it's a wanted poster for [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]]. Aliases include "the mad woodsman", the picture is of a much younger man with wrinkles added, crimes include being a [[Krozin, lord of chains|Krozin]] worshipping mage, and it notes that they are travelling with others in a black caravan.

Poleman attempts to salvage the poster, but the ink runs due to the water and it's only made worse. The courier remarks that he's paid a bronze per poster put up, and that this one was added at the last minute by the Western Legion. 

Poleman attempts to rejoin the Compainions, who are mostly sitting together at another table, but the courier follows him. Identifying Jovian as a priest, he asks if he might perform confession. Jovian accepts, and the two head off to an empty bedroom. Aethild follows stealthily.

The courier confesses that in his hurry to deliver the posters, the rain reducing visibility, and his poor eyesight due to cataracts, his horse ran over something but did not stop. He worries that it was a person. Jovian commands him to find the body and bury it, so that it may be preserved until resurrection. He also offers to try to help the courier's eyes, and successfully does so. Overjoyed, the courier heads back to the road, saying that he will take up another profession upon completing this final job.

Aethild steps outside, attempting to divine how long the rain will last by pissing into it. The wind blows the stream backwards into his face, to the amusement of a woman attempting to divine the same by throwing rocks.

The rain lets up in the evening, but we stay the night since it's a days travel to Mervil Manor. The owner mentions that Lord Mervil accepts all travellers as guests in his manor, something unique amongst the nobility, and that it would be foolish not to accept such hospitatility.

Astrid asks the owner if they have any spare whitewash, which they do, and has them give it to us in exchange for overpaying for the rooms. We whitewash the black caravan, as it is distinctive and known to the authorities. Poleman replaces the calligraphy, now black-on-white.

---

**Beohra, 11th of Summer**

We set off to Mervil Manor with no incidents, arriving in the evening. There appears to be a festival - tables are set out in the grounds, wagons parked around the place, with serving staff moving around from group to group.

A member of staff approaches and asks if we want anything: food, wine, bedding. Jago asks for bedding, and we ask what's going on. the staff member says this is normal and it's always like this, and that it's the wish of the lord to help people wherever possible, then moves on.

We catch another staff member to ask more questions (i forget the exact nature). they say that the lord will be coming out tonight to give a speech, and we should also expect to see his three daughters. they ask if we want to stay in a local inn or inside the manor house (for free, of course), but we say we'll camp near our wagon. the staff member laughs and says that people often do that the first night they stay here.

The party becomes suspicious there's some kind of magic on the grounds making everyone overly pliable and want to stay here (similar to an enchanted forest). Poleman says that no-one can alter his mind if he alters it first, and does a line of mandy.

The daughters (who all look like faeries) arrive and start mingling. We catch one of them and she says that her father is too unwell to give his planned speech, but, noting that we look like the adventurous sort, suggests she might lead us to him. Poleman wants to go but is already drunk off of the free beer, and everyone other than Jovian is too suspicious to enter the manor, so she takes Jovian alone, as a representative for the party.

- lots of magic in the throne room
- lord has a very clearly magic ring on
- lord denies all knowledge of magic (did he say anything about his ancestors or was that a bit? i forget)
- says the land is cursed and sucks and we should find out why, and this has been going on for at least a few months now
- he'll pay 12 silver for any actionable info, and a 60s (plus land/title) for solving the problem entirely
- suggests we start by looking into a single logging village within the swamp which hasn't been abandoned even though all other settlements nearby have been

Astrid gets super freaked out by how everyone who's partaken of the feast wants to move around a lot and not stay with the same group for very long.

We sleep around the caravan. during the night, [[Aggie Wargson]] (a jewler who had traveled with us from the inn) arrives and sleeps next to us.

---

**Talia, 11th of Summer**

[[Aggie Wargson|Aggie]] is described as a "canny acquisitor". She's got an offer of sponsorship from two of the sisters, and might stay in the manor if she can't set up a shop in Duruza. 

[[Rustia Criola de Mervil]] comes up and informs her that her room is ready and she's still on for lunch. She professes to the party that she is an Accorder, and that her father has taken the wrong approach in solving the curse. She offers to fetch a herbalist/cleric who had been thrown out of the manor for voicing his opinion.

The herbalist's name is [[Serego of Matrica]]. Says the curse has been going on for a year, and that coincides with a specific event: the raids on the western coast, Bjarni's Blood Brothers. He asserts that they bring the curse with them, like a plague. 

Curse symptoms (described by various people):
- torrential rains (possibly orod tast magic)
- more monsters in the bog, and disappearances, than usual
- tax
- not enough food
- roads are out, not enough supplies
- all the villages are abandoned

We learn that the bog monsters are bog ghasts, created when travellers in the moors get trapped in the mud and die. it is said they are possessed by bestial spirits of the land, giving them the head of a dog but the cunning of a man. Myths about these are common in the marshes, and sightings are rare but not unheard of.

Aethild asks Serego about potion recipes, and he says he'll compile some for when we get back.

Jovian performs a rite of safe passage so that we may pass through the swamp unhindered. The sloshing mud is turned, at least for those on foot. We cover the carriages to hide them, and leave Jago, his companion, and the children to guard as the rest of us press onwards.

in the town there's a lot of peat diggers, and some work ongoing to repair houses which are slightly askew (falling into the bog maybe). Fine Pete suggests we're not the first people to come here for the lord. Aethild punches him in the face, and they argue for a bit. We go to see the alderman instead. one of the townsfolk shouts that Hirumaya (the current empress) is his favourite god.

the alderman describes the curse as about what we expect, and says it's been going on for at least 7 or 8 months, but some folks say it's been going for longer. He invites us in, and asks us to take our boots off to avoid tracking mud in. He identifies himself as Delcin de Galimari.

He doesn't actually have much more info. Doesn't believe in curses. It's all just a run of bad luck. Metis, the most recently abandoned town, is a special case. It doesn't look like they took their things, there's signs of fighting, and no-one from there has been seen dead or alive. It was mostly abandoned already, though.

Jovian heard that people of Corvinum had been having visions, and asks the Alderman if he can speak to any. He is referred to an old reclusive lady, [[Livia de Vergo]], who the Alderman warns is crazy. She accuses Delcin as having mislead us intentionally. She says the curse is upon Don Mervil and his people, and looking at the land for the source of the curse is therefore fruitless.

She had previously worked for [[Anatona de Mervil]] as a maid. She was kind, but the house had financial troubles. When his wife died, [[Ludovic de Mervil]] set out on a business trip lasting 3 years. He came back with a deal (providing a steady flow of income, source unknown) and a daughter, but was now cold and ruthless. He took charge from his mother, and got put in charge of the finances. A month later, Anatona fell suddenly ill and died, but the Don didn't seem to care. All staff were fired.

Something was going on - carts coming in with stone, going out with dirt (some kind of secret basement? no visible construction works).

The youngest daughter has flowing golden hair, in contrast to the other two. nettie and corly are childhood nicknames for the elder two daughters. toy soldiers, war in the dining room over the dining table. nettie pulled the tablecloth and broke a fine crystal glass.

She says the ring is black, but it's actually yellow. The other details match up, so it seems like the ring changed over time.

Leading theory: the youngest daughter is some kind of demon/vampire, and is either puppeting the don or has similarly corrupted him (with the ring?).

We head to Metis to look for clues. Jovian and Aethild have the ultimate goal of returning to the manor, getting an audience with the ~~archdruid~~ Don, and somehow resolving the curse (via exorcism, cutting off the ring-hand, or just killing him).

---

The marsh appears to be trying to reclaim the road. Metis is a proper village. The grapes on the vineyard are all fresh and ripe and sweet. There's signs of light foraging, presumably from local wildlife.

Astrid gets the feeling that something is watching her from within the town. The doors, where they had locks, have been bashed in by a weapon (eg ax head) from the outside. There's brown stains everywhere, but no bodies. At least one storm has passed since, but they seem relatively recent. Within the houses, pots, linen are overturned but not taken, as if a hurried search was being performed.

There's no signs of clothing, arrows, or weapons at all. There is a lodge dedicated to lustre, the paragon of wine-making. There are no signs of desecration or damage to the contents of the lodge, besides the usual (door broken, personal possessions searched). Notably there's cheap jewellery which has not been taken.

The workshop door is ajar, but does not appear broken. There is a thin peice of twine looped around the inner door handle, trailing off into the darkness. it leads towards a home-made trap composed of three nocked bows. It appears that the trap has not been activated before. The inside of the workshop has been similarly looted. Kegs taken off the wall, wood pried off to access the contents (even though there are obviously taps). There are wine stains everywhere. ALL the wine-making equipment has been taken.

There's a square on the floor conspicuously free of wine stains. the wood here is different from the rest of the floor, and it's very thin and creaks as you put even a small amount of weight on it. There's a pit down there; it's dark and deep and the bottom (2m down) is full of metal (broken armour, tools, anything sharp) pointing upwards. There is a room down there. Poleman sees something move down there.

Poleman conjectures that theses traps were set by some kind of creature, rather than a person. Jovian recalls a great variety of demons (created by Letus) who could match.

We enact a plan: Aethild cries out in pain as if hit by a trap. We hear creaking from the floorboards below, and move quietly into combat positions. Astrid hears a floorboard creak as she steps, tries to correct, knocks over a barrel which was trapped and pulls down an entire shelf of barrels. She tries to dodge away, slips on spilt wine, falling on the ground. In a stroke of unimaginable misfortune, a barrel lands directly on her leg with a cracking sound. Another falls on the ground and splits open, spewing acid around the room. One of the barrels falls down the pit, and an inhuman high-pitched screech echoes through the building. Astrid (who is the only one with the right angle) see three more pairs of yellow eyes through the splintered floorboards. Combat begins.

Aethild recalls the specifics of these creatures. They tend to appear in villages that were raided, the malevolent embodiment of those who used to live here, acting out a mockery of human lives. They are voracious eaters for their size, and love eating things otherwise poisonous or noxious. They are afraid of fire and light. They're called witchlings or bruents.

They're small, about 1m, covered in black fur, yellow eyes and a long purple forked tongue. It's wearing shoes, tied with rope to keep them on, and trousers that are clearly too long for it. 

> mae: we should be careful here - they dont have much health, but worst case scenario they stab jovian, who has 0AV, for 6, triggering a wound, and it's bleeding
> 
> Hattie: Jovian is hard to kill. He doesn't need any armour because he's agile - I have 83 dodge.

Jovian walks towards a witchling, and another one pops out, stabbing him for 7 damage in a surprise attack. He gets a bleeding wound, which takes him down to 1hp by the end of the combat before it gets treated.

One of the witchlings eats something fuzzy from its pocket and starts burping a green gas. Its belly expands and bloats.

Astrid kills one with her bow while lying on the ground, Poleman kills two. A witchling outside rolls a cart in front of the door (it had previously prepared some barrels as a buffer stop). Aethild moves it out of the way. Jovian gives Astrid his staff to use as a crutch, and we head outside, having killed most of them.

Jovian's wound is bandaged and stops bleeding. Astrid bundles up her leg in the correct way. Poleman administers a potent aesthetic, then we regroup with the caravan and bunker down inside the most defensible looking house. A table is nailed in front of the doorway, since the door was broken in.

Jovian spends an hour in prayer, then heals himself. He contemplates healing Astrid, but decides against it, as she's not a fervent enough accorder. Poleman and Jovian argue for about half an hour over whether or not it's appropriate to desecrate holy sites because they're following a different religion to you (jovian for, poleman against).

Poleman takes first watch. For about 3 hours, nothing much happens, besides the occasional calls and hoots of the witchlings from across town. Then, a lone horseman, barely visible under the sliver of the almost-new moon, rides through town, stopping to inspect our carriages. Poleman puts out the lantern and watches from a window. The rider moves on, then stops and stares directly at Poleman (who is in total darkness), who is so startled by this he involuntarily gasps.

They're wearing a hooded cloak that goes down to their shoes. No other details could be made out. Poleman hails the rider, who says, in a low husky whisper:

>vulden par g'thrai 
>
>tesh kai rat'r

Then, when Poleman asks if they speak varlish, clicks their tongue and leaves. Poleman quickly writes this down, and asks the others if they recognise it. Nobody does, but Jovian, who knows a lot about languages, asserts that it's not related to any northen languages, and so presumably is from the deep south (umber, crown coast, lower grevuldur). It could alternatively be supernatural in origin.

The rest of the watch passes uneventfully.

---


**Mara 11th of Summer**

Poleman has a dream
- time flows backwards
- robed figure removes a small scratch from the caravan's whitewash with their dagger
- goes for days with nothing happening
- a dozen Revic people smashing down doors, looking around, and reporting back to a group of three robed figures, saying a single word to them
	- lighter furs, some bear-chested. battle scarred, a few with gold teeth. mismatched weapons/armour. No notable clan insignia on shields. There's one varnos shield, which the guy who dies had.
- the robes figures, seen in the daylight, are a dark green. Extremely nondescript.
- someone staggers out of the winery, head split open. lots of guys pile in, and drag out the corpse of a middle-aged varlish woman with her gut sliced open.

the scratch is verified.

we go back to the winery. the door is closed but everything seems as we left it. two people stay round the back to ambush any guys who come out.

going inside, all signs of battle have been removed - the bodies, the the debris. There's a pungent, sour smell. The moment the torch is inside the room, there's a popping sound and the entire house explodes, and is now on fire. poleman is too far into the room to see the door, and jumps into the pit to escape the fire.

the loot is: a load of small items, some valuable, most completely not. a few bits of jewellery. Nails pulled out of things.

A skull picked clean, a large cleft made with some kind of blade in the forehead. More bones, maybe three skulls and enough bones to match.

the building begins to collapse, poleman grabs a creature on the way out but it gets chopped in half on exit leaving only the legs.

we do phrenology on the skull and confirm it was a revic man, just as poleman saw in his dream.

3 places burn down, we knock known 

poleman lays out his notes on the ground.

- sees faces, lyvia, old mother, the duke (never met him), daughers, figures in robes, raiders, in a circle. draw lines, seeing them talk
- turns and looks at another, over and over
- suddenly: basement, endless, dark. rigid blocks of stone, rows and rows of cells. hands on bars, some gripping, some fallen on floor, in some none are present. flash of golden hair, cell door opens, someone cries out in joy then horror, blood runs through the bars.
- looking at one cell in particular with golden bars. there's a ring, with a polished black gem. recedes into blood red, clears into yellow, clears, cracks, the hand loosens their grip and slumps.

writing implements are depleted totally. A passage of text is circled by Astrid:

> [[Ludovic de Mervil|He]] came back with a [[Aulani Lavinia de Mervil|young daughter]], only a year old, and then [[Anatona de Mervil|my mistress]] fell ill, though she was hale and hearty before.

this rings a bell to Aethild. There are _so many_ person eating monsters. a few possibilities could be narrowed down by seeing the specimen, especially in a position of panic or alarm. weaknesses include:
- umbrum
- iron and silver, ideally blessed/enchanted
- shacking would slow it down and prevent changing shape
- arrogance - if they think they've defeated pray, they immediately try to eat them. if they consume something in so doing which hurts them, that'd put poision directly into their bloodstream.
	- holy water, regular poision, specific banes, or even healing plants are often toxic to these beings
		- honeysuckle, garlic

we start looking at alchemy:
- vials of brackish fluid, smells like rotten rose petals. stored next to crossbow bolts with special tips


we get a big ceramic vase with painted vines on the side, a crane is feasting on the grapes.

make some kind of potion
- herbs, garlic, wine, silver/iron dust.
- jovian blesses the wine to make it holy.
- jago seals the cask to make it look un-tampered with.

as we ride back, astrid spots some people with house mervil colours, and a woman in a riding dress. Astrid approaches, they hail and ask if we ride from metis. The woman is [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]]. They appear suspicious of us. Astrid explains what happened:
- there was  fire (they saw it over the horizon) but we spent hours stopping it from spreading.
- it was caused by a monster in metis as a means of attacking us
- we killed it and have brought the body back

she takes us aside, without any guards, about 15m off the road. she says she's involved in the efforts to solve the curse, and she may have evidence which could corroborate ours.

Jovian suggets mass conversion, and she thinks that's a stupid and impractical idea.

we try to read her:
- mention the krozin guy, she seems to be digging for something
- mention she's next in line, she blinks a bit too suddenly and says yes
	- it doesn't seem like she's totally confident in that
- ask if she thinks her sisters are fit to inherit.
	- middle sister is a bit fanciful, little interest in finance, trying to leave the house as soon as possible
	- lavinia never had a head for anything other than play, song and dance.
	- she's being mostly honest here, but not entirely.
- lavinia "has the run of the place" - she's always off doing something
- we compare the fall of their house to Arati, and the revic territories. she falls quiet and says "well that's a lot to think about"
- she says she makes reports on everyone coming and going and she'd know if anyone was going missing.
- jovian checks her for magic, and she's not enchanted
- we ask about a few other things
- we ask about the figures in green robes - she recounts him getting letters from somewhere a long way away and then hurriedly leaving the house. he'd be away for at most two days.

we lay everything out, completely trusting her
- we mention the food
	- she says she's been in the kitchens and knows nothing is being done to the food
- we mention the construction 
	- she says it's a wine cellar
- we go through the rest of the events without mentioning anything magical
- we then go over it again, mentioning the magic
- on mentioning lyvia's she blanches - she's been dead for 10 years.

we convince her something is up, and she agrees to help. We'll fix this. We'll fix this together.

poleman asks for writing tools and a plan of the manor, which is to be delivered in the morning.

we get a meeting with the duke scheduled in for tomorrow

we ask for her to allow us to investigate the basement somehow (eg under the pretence of a tour of the manor)

During the night Poleman is shaken awake by Jovian for his watch. We leave under cover of darkness. We will never return to Mervil Manor.

**Harla 11th of Summer**

inquisition is in barcini

Gunter: last night, people with robes
> asking about strainge things, calcium equm, posit sofit dereit
> "he" would be useful real soon because she's leaving for a few days and she's going to come back when she's finished her buisness
> "is it true you depared the estate" yeah i got a little bit out and was stopped by one of the guards and accused me of stealing from someone and i've got tto go back to one of those stone buildings
> never spoke to a lady but i spoke to two. brown hair, older. asked what we were about, what skills we had. said we were good to stay for free but it'd be appreciated if we did tasks around the place eg weed the gardens. i said "shove it" that doesn't sound like a free meal or stay. must have affended someone they accused me of stealing
> it was just the duke, some of the guards, and those fellas in the robes. they said i'd been tried in advance and found guilty. 10 years hard labour, but idk when that's meant to start i've just been down here.

speak to serago:
> oh hello. i'd been told i wouldnt be eating anything for the next few days.
> i was forced out; i got a tip off. told that a second cousin was dying and needed urgent medical care. i rode out, but another horse raced into the path. crossbow was drawn and i was lead back here, through the stables by a strange foreign looking fellow. green robes.
> no mock trail or anything like that. only saw that witch daughter
> asked about ingredients. looking for replacements for ingredients of a foreign nature. can't get them around here. increase potency and duration. in particular not poisonous and wouldn't damage a hard-to-achieve effect from other ingredients. presumably planning on drinking it. not related to life extension. 


we take nezetta aside and ask if she could pay is instead of the duke. she says she would but isnt in charge of finances. 

astrid suggests we seek help from the other noble houses. she says she doesnt know the empress very well and she's old freinds with the don.

nezetta suggests that we ensure that only the house guard loyal to her are present when we confront her father, and take him in chains to duruza. we could take all the horses such that none are left to follow us with. 

poleman suggests additionally that we sent a rider to the inquisition, with instruction to inform them of everything if our confrontation goes wrong.

jovian uses a spell to open a random door. it's [[Jan the Jagged|Jan the fucking Jagged]]. We contemplate releasing all of the prisoners and having them lead an armed insurrection against the duke.

we also let out
- ravin' variner
	- personal friend of Jan
- [[Serego of Matrica|Serego]]
- Gunter
- 4 more criminals who jan seems to know
- 2 people who don't speak varlish (probably from an island)
- a younger kremish guy. poor as shit. missing a bunch of teeth. afraid of everyone.

it occurs to poleman that we can probably get the legion on side.

we should probably just tell the criminals to fuck off

we probably tell criola that we found serego in a prison cell in the basement and that she needs to go get the inquisition right now immediately.

aethild asks everyone what the blonde-haired woman.
> i've been here longer than anyone else. 2 cellmates who she came to visit. talked through the doors until they were gone. all accused of something. me arson. she came by and spoke to them one night, and left, and i heard him spitting and gurgling. by the morning he stopped making noises. she took a look at him and got one of her friends to drag him out.
> this only happened to the one on my left. the woman on my right who had been here for 4 days. the figures in the robe took her and took her up the stairs. never heard from her again

she's testing potions presumably.

we consider sending the krem, criola, and a party member to the inquisition, but we'd need to time it such that they arrive after the coup had succeed.

we tell jan to fuck off and he asks for a dagger, which we give to him. then he asks for gunter, who he accuses of being a criminal. aethild interrogates gunter to confirm this, and he confesses:

> i may have made some bad friends in my time. i don't steal anything myself, i promise. just tell them where i think the stealing's good. windows, guard patterns. i just tell people things.

jovian bargains them down to a single eye, and we usher everyone else who is presumed innocent out of the prison into the wine cellar. jovian stays behind to keep order.

oh fuck me the logistics of this coup is really complex fuuuck me im so anxious i just wanna get it over with but we're so hung up on details

Porchioni brothers, personal guards of the duke. reachable by bell. on watch specifically because the duke is meeting with mercs.

try to smuggle out serego to go convince the legionnaires to escort us into the city, giving us the stamp of imperial authority. we smuggle out serego of the basement in a maid dress. the legionnaires left about half an hour ago. aethild riles out on a horse to try to catch up with them, with some difficulty, and tells them about serego getting kidnapped and being held in a secret basement by the duke, which convinces them to come back.

while jan is interrogating gunter, he mentions Bjarni's Blood Brothers. They're well connected raiders in the area and have informants who tell them where the legion is (and is not). gunter says he 

 > doesn't know much, but got messed up with the blood brothers in duruza. real crackdown in east harbor, needed to get out of the city. was paid a lot to travel to metis. looked around, noted how many people, what kind of protections. went to traveli inn by the name of "white whale" to meet a lady named curs. told her, she said "dont work with the raiders, it's done. another job" paid a lot. cased the manor, but they sniffed me out, was caught and thrown in here.

oh no now jan knows metis has been burned down partially and wants another lead. jovian recommends rurica or burgernham. jan intimidates gunter into joining his gang. jovina has more questions
> what told to find for raiders?
> wanted a list of people in the town. knew it was partly abandoned. how many living, and where. little map. scout nearby hills - where nearest armed force responds from. what kind of people left - young/strong vs old/sickly. 
> likely slavers
> uhh i have no idea. could be a census for all i know.
> jan: the blood brothers have the connections for slaving

jovian knocks on gunters skull. it echoes.

gunter cracks and says that both rurica and burgernham are abandoned. jan is pleased, and gunter is released, and then stabbed in the throat. he dies.

jan tries to recruit jovian, arguing that he'll work together to get revenge on the duke. jovian appears completely swayed by this, and recommends they focus poleman down first, and then goes down through the rest of the party suggesting our weaknesses. jan asks for more weapons and says he can get them by killing the guards up by the stable.

jovian comes out and tells poleman and co everything that happened in there and we, after some debate, agree to kill them all.

meathead ted (tedwyn) gets away on a horse, but all other bandits, including Jan, are killed or incapacitated. Noticing the disturbance, Nezetta brings the guards she's trying to convince to the stable to show them what her father had been doing, at which point Jovian immolates the one remaining bandit, who had surrendered.

Nezetta suggests that now would be a good time to confront her father, but no-one jumps at the idea. Poleman goes to get Astrid, who remained by the wagons, and is preparing to leave. Astrid refuses to join in, and continues her preparations. Nezetta dismisses her guards and they go into the house to take their positions.

The duke arrives at the stable with his personal guard (and presumably changes out the on-duty guards at around this time to ones loyal to him). He moves to arrest Nezetta and Jovian, but Jovian starts accusing the Duke of his crimes (mostly performing for the crowd that has now formed as a result of all the commotion). Poleman tries to get into the house, but the guards on the door have been changed and move to arrest him. Poleman turns and sprints away from the house, in the general direction (but not directly towards) Astrid and the caravan, pursued by two guards. Astrid sees this and, having loaded up everything she needed into her wagon, leaves with [[Serego of Matrica]] and the orphans.

One of the guards, seeing that they aren't going to catch up with Poleman on foot, stops and fires a crossbow bolt, which misses. Astrid helps from afar, causing the second bolt to miss and hit the other guard. The two stop perusing shortly afterwords. Astrid, having not noticeably committed any crimes, gets away safely. Poleman runs all the way back to Luruna.

Jovian wins over the crowd and, after some prevarication, attempts to flee. Guards peruse him into the crowd, but are stopped. He makes it back to the remaining wagon, along with Jago and Juevo. They attempt to flee, but are perused by mounted guards. Jago scoops up [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who is on the floor for some reason. She has a bag full of jewellery. Jago and Juevo take the bag and untie the horses, fleeing, and leaving the caravan to stop. Jovian demands the guards do not persure them, and they obey, fearful for Criola's life.

Once his friends have safely escaped, Jovian releases Criola, and demands he is executed on the spot. This demand is met, and he is decapitated. Fresh water continually flows from his neck instead of blood, forming a spring which eventually grows so deep his body can no longer be seen. This proves to all watching that he was, undoubtedly, a saint.
