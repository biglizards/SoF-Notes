we arrive at arx, the fortification where the prefect lives. We ask about the tower we're aiming to take and the surrounding area, and get some info:

false moon spire:
- the false moon appears as made of gold in people's dreams
- the spire is said to be the home of (TODO) - one of the old Yrric pantheon
	- the tower acts kind of like a lighthouse, guiding the souls of the dead to their final resting place
	- the area within the tower's shadow seems like it should be left uninhabited save for the dead
- people from places with a direct line of sight to the tower have been abandoning their settlements to go to the tower - they seem to think they will find a better life there
- people of Moli appear immune to this affect
- recently the tower was discovered in the same place people reported seeing the false moon by people from Moli
	- it's partly embedded into the mountain and is made of solid black stone, with no doors
	- it's known to be of Atavan make
- an expedition made of scholars from the university of Murga and some local legionaries departed two seasons ago (in spring). they were escorted by a guide from moli
	- when the guide returned with supplies two weeks later, they found no trace of the expedition
- Tibretto reported that surrounding mountains looks like it was hewn by giants (but that's not abnormal)
	- observing it at night he saw a solid, bright green glow from behind one of the peaks, coming from where you'd imagine the tower would be

Fonsano lore:
- logging town by sotton grove, fortification made of wood (population 200)
- owned by logging lodge
	- not great reputation with local peasants
- reports of deserters in the nearby woods
	- people are afraid and some are leaving out of fear
	- legionaries were left but the townsfolk mistrusted them 
- too many people patrolling
	- poorly co-ordinated
	- weapons are scrappy and varied
- some of the houses partially disassembled to make fortification

Cynzoval lore:
- current population is 40, but could house 300
- quarry up against the mountain range, but no through route to the ester woods
- seems especially ravaged by the false moon spire
- has enough food to last the winter, but not enough population to properly function come the spring

Halfdan does a ritual involving a raven watching him sleep and speaks to some spirits
- the colour green (palid, dark, desaturated) gets really bright and is then blocked by something
- "but this was long, long ago. this dweller of the void left something behind, something that draws in folk even now, something powerful, something to make the meekest into the mightiest hero - something to grant wishes
- "what dangers await us: only other seekers. the treasure is so valuable, only minds vast like yours and ours know to desire it."

Come the morning, we inform the prefect about what we saw in Fonsano, and she, like us, suspects something bad is going on. She gives us her seal and tells us to talk to the mayor of Fonsano, who is authorised to pay us to deal with whatever problem has caused them to suddenly fortify so desperately.

We arrive outside the palisade in early evening - it's winter, and the mountains steal much of what little sun remains, so we only have 8 hours if light to travel by. We note four archers posted on the walls, and 6 men in shoddy armour come out to greet us. One introduces themselves as the captain, and also the mayor. We ask a few probing questions, hoping he contradicts what the Prefect told us about the townspeople, and he does. Tibretto asks about his time in the army - he's wearing the armour of a legionnaire - and gets the impression that, while he did serve, it was long ago.

We intuit that these men are the deserters who had been harassing the townsfolk. Tibretto slips off to inform the cavelry to charge, and we stall for a few moments longer. As the men are about to leave, Halfdan quickdraws his longsword and spills the guts of the captain onto the ground. A battle ensues, but entirely one-sided - the only wounded on our side was a legionnaire whose horse mysteriously exploded. We kill four of them, take one prisoner, and confiscate the weapons and armour of three - the other two were too close to the walls when killed, and we didn't dare enter range of the archers.

Njall interrogates the prisoner. He is uncooperative, but eventually persuaded to talk. He confirms that the deserters took over the town, and that he thinks this is a good thing. His arm is withered and frostbitten, and he seems tired. Satisfied, Njall leaves, and Tibretto takes her place, asking questions with a much warmer demeanor, to great effect.

captured guy spills the details:
- deserters attacked the town a little, and travelers nearby
- the town paid them off by giving them some lumber, and the attacks stopped
	- everyone seemed fine with this and the lodge grew complacent
- having lulled them into a false sense of security, the deserters entered the town and slaughtered the lodge officials (which the peasants were happy with and even participated in).
- the townsfolk armed themselves and established a militia and defences with the aim of demanding better treatment from the Prefect (no taxes, they collect tarrifs on wood, etc) come the spring.
	- there's about 40 men in the militia, but only about 20 of them could be armed at any time due to weapons shortages
		- we killed 5 of them, and confiscated 3 weapons
- about 50 people have gone off into the sorrows (towards the false moon spire) and didn't come back - looking for sheep or the lost.
	- more sheep and goats go off when the moon is growing, and at a full moon people go to track them down

We return to the Arx to get further instructions from the Prefect, as there is no longer a mayor to pay us, and the situation seems too sensitive to not get her opinion on. She takes a few of us aside and says the following:

- Since the nivish legion is composed of armed peasantry, there are likely many within its ranks which would by sympathetic to the people of Fonsano. She fears a mutiny should she use her own forces to attack the town to bring them to heel
- The demands of the town are non-negotiable - they _will_ be brought to heel come the spring, it's just a matter of who does it
	- The logging lodge has been concerned that they have had no regular reports or other correspondence from Fonsano for many weeks now, and will eventually investigate and raise an army to re-establish control
	- If she requested it, the Despot would loan her an army from Niiva
	- both of these options would undermine the legitimacy of the Prefect as ruler of the area, which is bad for _us_ because our only claim to the land stems from the Prefect
- She suggests that we raise an overwhelming force in the nearby city of Murga, and offers us:
	- 30 silver in cash
	- A letter of credit good for 20 silver per week, to pay the raised troops with
	- 75 silver in cash upon completion
- We estimate that, since it takes around a day to travel from the Arx to Murga, we could (if everything goes smoothly) raise the army, travel to Fonsano, leave the army as an occupying force, and travel onwards to the False Moon Spire on (or one night after) the full moon, in which with any luck the spire will be open.
