[[Astrid Knutsdir|Astrid]] has gone into hiding, and Aethild has been given significant funding to create a mercenary party as a blue-sky project by both Fatima and Astrid('s supporters), totalling around 150 silver. He gathered various adventuring sort, namely:

- Vitaly von Brom, a strongman
- Uncle Tibretto, an elderly wanderer with a sharp mind and sharper aim
- Hlafdan, a speaker-in-training, and his (not related by blood) sister Leif
- Glyndŵr/Glendower, a quiet kremish woman
- Njall, a veiled foreign archaeologist, and her apprentice/bodyguard/blacksmith Saga

The newly formed party investigated any rumour they can get their hands on as to a location to create their headquaters, and after dismissing most leads for being "too political" they narrowed it down to two - a ruined town within the monster-infested Estir Woods, and a recently discovered ancient tower in the Nivish Sorrows. The tower won out for two main reasons: defensibly and likelihood of containing ancient loot.

The party hires the kinds of people you'd need to capture and man a fortress: 6 footmen, two mercinaries, two dozen livestock and the üslings needed to look after them, a master carpenter, a chef, a castellan, and a ratcatcher, along with a huge amount of various equipment. As a gesture of good faith, Saga lends Halfdan her masterwork chainmail, as he volunteers to take point in any battles.

Two main political forces within Nivina could lay claim to the tower. The first is the Prefect of the South Sorrows, whose lands the tower resides in the edges of. The second is the Caravaneers Lodge, who would be able to take over the tower and the land surrounding it by naming it a trading post (although this would require finding and exploiting a path through the mountains to Marodell, which isn't guaranteed to be possible). Both lack the manpower to take and hold the tower, and both make quite favourable deals to the party in exchange for a cut: the Prefect would collect taxes, and the Caravaneers would use the trading post for trade.

The Caravaneers are able to offer a better deal, owing to the fact that trading posts are entitled to patrol and make use of all land from which the post could be scouted, but the party isn't sold on the additional foot trafic (and therefore accountability) that Lodge presence would bring. Tibretto is sent to negotiate with the Prefect, and strikes an extremely good deal:

> Your party is allowed through, and is free to not only preferentially use the whole of the nearby foothills but also to dismantle or repurpose any abandoned properties in that area. You may even sow the ground in what little arable space may be found in the region, as well as mine the treasures of the mountain.
> 
> However, for the Prefect to trust your good intention they need three guarantees in return: first, any peasants who are rescued or return to the area around the tower, and refuse to leave their ancestral homes or lands, must be given equal status as citizens of your Koloneia.
> 
> Second, you must guarantee basic rights within your domain - slaves are to be freed upon entry, the land and property of the folk is to be respected, and punishment must not be unjustly dealt or misdealt.  Any non-idle complaints over these points to the prefect will warrant an inspection, and possibly a revocation of the grant. 
> 
> Finally, you cannot mass import folk from other realms - for every non-Nivish citizen to join your ranks, a Niv must be recruited as well. The Prefect generously offers to present you with any number of discharged legionnaires should you seek to expand your forces.

![[Pasted image 20251121163721.png]] *A map of south-east Nivena. The area between the False Moon Spire and the bridge near Arx Dalorans constitutes the South Sorrows.*

We arrive at Arx Dalorans, the fortification where the prefect lives. We ask about the tower we're aiming to take and the surrounding area, and get some info about the [[False Moon Spire]] and the folklore surrounding it, as well as the towns of [[Fonsano]] and [[Cynzoval]].

Tibretto, with permission from the Prefect, climbs to the top of the Arx's watchtower to scout the local land. He sees that everyone in Fonsano appears armed with poor quality weapons, and that they had deconstructed some of their houses to form a palisade. He also sees a green glow coming from where we would expect the False Moon Spire to be.

Halfdan does a ritual involving a raven watching him sleep and speaks to some spirits, and sees visions involving:

- the colour green (palid, dark, desaturated) gets really bright and is then blocked by something
- "but this was long, long ago. this dweller of the void left something behind, something that draws in folk even now, something powerful, something to make the meekest into the mightiest hero - something to grant wishes
- "what dangers await us: only other seekers. the treasure is so valuable, only minds vast like yours and ours know to desire it."

Come the morning, we inform the prefect about what we saw in Fonsano, and she, like us, suspects something bad is going on. She gives us her seal and tells us to talk to the mayor of Fonsano, who is authorised to pay us to deal with whatever problem has caused them to suddenly fortify so desperately.

We arrive outside the palisade in early evening - it's winter, and the mountains steal much of what little sun remains, so we only have 8 hours if light to travel by. We note four archers posted on the walls, and 6 men in shoddy armour come out to greet us. One introduces themselves as the captain, and also the mayor. We ask a few probing questions, hoping he contradicts what the Prefect told us about the townspeople, and he does. Tibretto asks about his time in the army - he's wearing the armour of a legionnaire - and gets the impression that, while he did serve, it was long ago.

We intuit that these men are the deserters who had been harassing the townsfolk. Tibretto slips off to inform the cavalry to charge, and we stall for a few moments longer. As the men are about to leave, Halfdan quickdraws his longsword and spills the guts of the captain onto the ground. A battle ensues, but entirely one-sided - the only wounded on our side was a legionnaire whose horse mysteriously exploded. We kill four of them, take one prisoner, and confiscate the weapons and armour of three - the other two were too close to the walls when killed, and we didn't dare enter range of the archers.

Njall interrogates the prisoner. He is uncooperative, but eventually persuaded to talk. He confirms that the deserters took over the town, and that he thinks this is a good thing. His arm is withered and frostbitten, and he seems tired. Satisfied, Njall leaves, and Tibretto takes her place, asking questions with a much warmer demeanour, to great effect.

captured guy spills the details:
- deserters attacked the town a little, and travellers nearby
- the town paid them off by giving them some lumber, and the attacks stopped
	- everyone seemed fine with this and the lodge grew complacent
- having lulled them into a false sense of security, the deserters entered the town and slaughtered the lodge officials (which the peasants were happy with and even participated in).
- the townsfolk armed themselves and established a militia and defences with the aim of demanding better treatment from the Prefect (no taxes, they collect tarrifs on wood, etc) come the spring.
	- there's about 40 men in the militia, but only about 20 of them could be armed at any time due to weapons shortages
		- we killed 5 of them, and confiscated 3 weapons
- about 50 people have gone off into the sorrows (towards the false moon spire) and didn't come back - looking for sheep or the lost.
	- more sheep and goats go off when the moon is growing, and at a full moon people go to track them down

We return to the Arx to get further instructions from the Prefect, as there is no longer a mayor to pay us, and the situation seems too sensitive to not get her opinion on. She takes a few of us aside and says the following:

- Since the nivish legion is composed of armed peasantry, there are likely many within its ranks which would by sympathetic to the people of Fonsano. She fears a mutiny should she use her own forces to attack the town to bring them to heel
- The demands of the town are non-negotiable - they _will_ be brought to heel come the spring, it's just a matter of who does it
	- The logging lodge has been concerned that they have had no regular reports or other correspondence from Fonsano for many weeks now, and will eventually investigate and raise an army to re-establish control
	- If she requested it, the Despot would loan her an army from Niiva
	- both of these options would undermine the legitimacy of the Prefect as ruler of the area, which is bad for _us_ because our only claim to the land stems from the Prefect
- She suggests that we raise an overwhelming force in the nearby city of Murga, and offers us:
	- 30 silver in cash
	- A letter of credit good for 20 silver per week, to pay the raised troops with
	- 75 silver in cash upon completion
- We estimate that, since it takes around a day to travel from the Arx to Murga, we could (if everything goes smoothly) raise the army, travel to Fonsano, leave the army as an occupying force, and travel onwards to the False Moon Spire on (or one night after) the full moon, in which with any luck the spire will be open.
