[[Astrid Knutsdir|Astrid]] has gone into hiding, and Aethild has been given significant funding to create a mercenary party as a blue-sky project by both Fatima and Astrid('s supporters), totalling around 150 silver. He gathered various adventuring sort, namely:

- Vitaly von Brom, a strongman
- Uncle Tibretto, an elderly wanderer with a sharp mind and sharper aim
- Hlafdan, a speaker-in-training, and his (not related by blood) sister Leif
- Glyndŵr/Glendower, a quiet kremish woman
- Njall, a veiled foreign archaeologist, and her apprentice/bodyguard/blacksmith Saga

The newly formed party investigated any rumour they can get their hands on as to a location to create their headquaters, and after dismissing most leads for being "too political" they narrowed it down to two - a ruined town within the monster-infested Estir Woods, and a recently discovered ancient tower in the Nivish Sorrows. The tower won out for two main reasons: defensibly and likelihood of containing ancient loot.

The party hires the kinds of people you'd need to capture and man a fortress: 6 footmen, two mercinaries, two dozen livestock and the üslings needed to look after them, a master carpenter, a chef, a castellan, and a ratcatcher, along with a huge amount of various equipment. As a gesture of good faith, Saga lends Halfdan her masterwork chainmail, as he volunteers to take point in any battles.

Two main political forces within Nivina could lay claim to the tower. The first is the Prefect of the South Sorrows, whose lands the tower resides in the edges of. The second is the Caravaneers Lodge, who would be able to take over the tower and the land surrounding it by naming it a trading post (although this would require finding and exploiting a path through the mountains to Marodell, which isn't guaranteed to be possible). Both lack the manpower to take and hold the tower, and both make quite favourable deals to the party in exchange for a cut: the Prefect would collect taxes, and the Caravaneers would use the trading post for trade.

The Caravaneers are able to offer a better deal, owing to the fact that trading posts are entitled to patrol and make use of all land from which the post could be scouted, but the party isn't sold on the additional foot trafic (and therefore accountability) that Lodge presence would bring. Tibretto is sent to negotiate with the Prefect, and strikes an extremely good deal:

> Your party is allowed through, and is free to not only preferentially use the whole of the nearby foothills but also to dismantle or repurpose any abandoned properties in that area. You may even sow the ground in what little arable space may be found in the region, as well as mine the treasures of the mountain.
> 
> However, for the Prefect to trust your good intention they need three guarantees in return: first, any peasants who are rescued or return to the area around the tower, and refuse to leave their ancestral homes or lands, must be given equal status as citizens of your Koloneia.
> 
> Second, you must guarantee basic rights within your domain - slaves are to be freed upon entry, the land and property of the folk is to be respected, and punishment must not be unjustly dealt or misdealt.  Any non-idle complaints over these points to the prefect will warrant an inspection, and possibly a revocation of the grant. 
> 
> Finally, you cannot mass import folk from other realms - for every non-Nivish citizen to join your ranks, a Niv must be recruited as well. The Prefect generously offers to present you with any number of discharged legionnaires should you seek to expand your forces.

![[Pasted image 20251121163721.png]] *A map of south-east Nivena. The area between the False Moon Spire and the bridge near Arx Dalorans constitutes the South Sorrows.*

We arrive at Arx Dalorans, the fortification where the prefect lives. We ask about the tower we're aiming to take and the surrounding area, and get some info about the [[False Moon Spire]] and the folklore surrounding it, as well as the towns of [[Fonsano]] and [[Cynzoval]].

Tibretto, with permission from the Prefect, climbs to the top of the Arx's watchtower to scout the local land. He sees that everyone in Fonsano appears armed with poor quality weapons, and that they had deconstructed some of their houses to form a palisade. He also sees a green glow coming from where we would expect the False Moon Spire to be.

Halfdan does a ritual involving a raven watching him sleep and speaks to some spirits, and sees visions involving:

- the colour green (palid, dark, desaturated) gets really bright and is then blocked by something
- "but this was long, long ago. this dweller of the void left something behind, something that draws in folk even now, something powerful, something to make the meekest into the mightiest hero - something to grant wishes
- "what dangers await us: only other seekers. the treasure is so valuable, only minds vast like yours and ours know to desire it."

---

Come the morning, we inform the prefect about what we saw in Fonsano, and she, like us, suspects something bad is going on. She gives us her seal and tells us to talk to the mayor of Fonsano, who is authorised to pay us to deal with whatever problem has caused them to suddenly fortify so desperately.

We arrive outside the palisade in early evening - it's winter, and the mountains steal much of what little sun remains, so we only have 8 hours if light to travel by. We note four archers posted on the walls, and 6 men in shoddy armour come out to greet us. One introduces themselves as the captain, and also the mayor. We ask a few probing questions, hoping he contradicts what the Prefect told us about the townspeople, and he does. Tibretto asks about his time in the army - he's wearing the armour of a legionnaire - and gets the impression that, while he did serve, it was long ago.

We intuit that these men are the deserters who had been harassing the townsfolk. Tibretto slips off to inform the cavalry to charge, and we stall for a few moments longer. As the men are about to leave, Halfdan quickdraws his longsword and spills the guts of the captain onto the ground. A battle ensues, but entirely one-sided - the only wounded on our side was a legionnaire whose horse mysteriously exploded. We kill four of them, take one prisoner, and confiscate the weapons and armour of three - the other two were too close to the walls when killed, and we didn't dare enter range of the archers.

Njall interrogates the prisoner. He is uncooperative, but eventually persuaded to talk. He confirms that the deserters took over the town, and that he thinks this is a good thing. His arm is withered and frostbitten, and he seems tired. Satisfied, Njall leaves, and Tibretto takes her place, asking questions with a much warmer demeanour, to great effect.

captured guy spills the details:
- deserters attacked the town a little, and travellers nearby
- the town paid them off by giving them some lumber, and the attacks stopped
	- everyone seemed fine with this and the lodge grew complacent
- having lulled them into a false sense of security, the deserters entered the town and slaughtered the lodge officials (which the peasants were happy with and even participated in).
- the townsfolk armed themselves and established a militia and defences with the aim of demanding better treatment from the Prefect (no taxes, they collect tarrifs on wood, etc) come the spring.
	- there's about 40 men in the militia, but only about 20 of them could be armed at any time due to weapons shortages
		- we killed 5 of them, and confiscated 3 weapons
- about 50 people have gone off into the sorrows (towards the false moon spire) and didn't come back - looking for sheep or the lost.
	- more sheep and goats go off when the moon is growing, and at a full moon people go to track them down

We return to the Arx to get further instructions from the Prefect, as there is no longer a mayor to pay us, and the situation seems too sensitive to not get her opinion on. She takes a few of us aside and says the following:

- Since the nivish legion is composed of armed peasantry, there are likely many within its ranks which would by sympathetic to the people of Fonsano. She fears a mutiny should she use her own forces to attack the town to bring them to heel
- The demands of the town are non-negotiable - they _will_ be brought to heel come the spring, it's just a matter of who does it
	- The logging lodge has been concerned that they have had no regular reports or other correspondence from Fonsano for many weeks now, and will eventually investigate and raise an army to re-establish control
	- If she requested it, the Despot would loan her an army from Niiva
	- both of these options would undermine the legitimacy of the Prefect as ruler of the area, which is bad for _us_ because our only claim to the land stems from the Prefect
- She suggests that we raise an overwhelming force in the nearby city of Murga, and offers us:
	- 30 silver in cash
	- A letter of credit good for 20 silver per week, to pay the raised troops with
	- 75 silver in cash upon completion
- We estimate that, since it takes around a day to travel from the Arx to Murga, we could (if everything goes smoothly) raise the army, travel to Fonsano, leave the army as an occupying force, and travel onwards to the False Moon Spire on (or one night after) the full moon, in which with any luck the spire will be open.

---

We travel to Murga, and raise a force of 35 men:
- a band of shadeling pirates, the Blue Squid's Brood
- 11 off-duty legionarres (5 bowmen, 6 footmen)
- 10 marines, the Prima Florriers
- 8 university students (cavalry)

We march back to Fonsano. During the night, we hear wolves howling, and double the watch and stoke a fire to ward them off. They do not attack, but we lost a goat in the night regardless (presumably it wandered off due to the Spire's influence).

The plan is as follows: two bands of archers approach from west and the south and engage with those on top of the walls. Cavalry would remain at range, patrolling the perimeter to ensure no-one flees into the plains. After firing begins, the footmen charge at the gates and break through, first climbing the walls and finishing off the remaining archers, then sweeping through the town towards various key objectives:
- the barracks, in which hostages are being held
- the inn, which is being used as a barracks; and
- the north of the town, which becomes forested without fortification
	- if enough enemy combatants escape into the woods they may engage in protracted guerrilla warfare

The plan was executed more-or-less successfully, with few casualties on our side (a few mercs were injured and given hazard pay, notably including TODO NAME, who was sent home).

The south team reached the barracks, where they were met with agitated townsfolk explaining their side of the story: they were being worked to death by guild in the harsh winter, and their pleas for better working conditions had fallen upon deaf ears - they had been driven to violent uprising only out of necessity, rather than greed. The party is sympathetic, and agrees to hold a trial as a way to ease tensions and provide catharsis.

In the trial, the most senior lodge member is beheaded for unusual cruelty and wanton disregard for human life, and the other lodge members are given token punishments. This broadly appeases the townsfolk. An elder explains to the party that the uprising was primarily inspired by three ringleaders:
- Two legionnaire deserters, one of whom had already been killed.
	- i think they were partners?
- A student from Murga, who we are warned is a concerning compelling orator.

Meanwhile, Njall has drawn a circle of blood around the tavern, which contains a considerable number of soldiers and the other deserter ringleader, and instils terror into them. The rest of the party arrives, and we demand that the ringleader is sent out or we'll kill everyone in there (bluffing). Everyone other than the ringleader agrees, and we open the door to him standing in the middle and everyone else cowering around the edges.

Halfdan tries to grapple him and bring him out of the inn (for interrogation), but he resists, shouting something about honour and how we killed his boyfriend that i dont really remember. He escapes Halfdan's grasp, steps in the blood circle, and is frozen solid, shaking with fear. Halfdan, in anger, runs him through.

We head north to the area that

---

Njall reads the diary 
- "A" has a butterfly mask that they brought with them. Something to do with their personal religion.
- Something about Adal Nacar
	- noble name from astarin (carmine isles)
- names: "G", "V", "I", "A", and "D"
	- "A" first mentioned on first sight of the tower, all other letters mentioned before that
- two separate periods - travel log until they get to the tower, then a sketch, then ramblings about geists and dreams and republicanism written in an almost different hand (more frantic, less grace).

path to moli has various dead animals, dead/gored wolves, goat horns embedded in a tree, 7 dead sparrows (crushed). Arrows in trees. A crude falling rock trap contains an inscription in blood: "hunter of day, become prey by night"

weird cult in moli
- double-sided butterfly mask
- one of them called ivar
- at least a dozen
- moli would prefer if we didn't kill them all
- trying to do good in their own way
- old lady scabala went over to their side
- gauso, cranky old fool, stayed a night and came back

in meet hall:
- elders ask us to drive out the weird cult for (probably) poaching their cattle for blood rituals

we meet with gauso
- he's the guide, up to the tower
- guided the scholars. either 5 or 6, cant remember which
- when he returned, one of them was dead, surrounded by blood.
- tower is a curse. anywhere the moss doesn't grow is bad.
- went to speak with the cult, found the one he recognised as it "smells of dust and book glue"
	- asked which one of them died on the mountain
	- "the great change", something about dreams
- asked about names:
	- Ivar, leader of cult
	- Hortenza philosopher,
	- doesn't remember Adal Nacar
	- Gustava, strange smell. sharp, singed his nose hairs.

Party talks with Ivar for a bit and he seems reasonable
- we ask what his goal is and he talks about Adal Nacar and how he's a normal guy who's stuck in the upper part of the tower somehow and can't leave because the tower is extremely trapped. He communicates with everyone, including a group of 5 dozen cultists, with an insane avatar he calls Herald True Light.
- He brings out the original butterfly/moth mask made of bronze - it has a significant amount of umbrum in. it used to belong to Adal Nacar but he gave it to Ivar for some reason shortly after they met. Adal Nacar has since gone completely mad due to continual exposure to the false moon without any umbrum.
	- the bronze symbolises the union of the twin cities of tin and copper and is culturally important to the peryite cult who seek to control both cities
- He knows and freely admits that the umbral mask protected him from the immortality/insanity combo.
- He says something that implies he was left outside the tower while everyone else went in
- He claims he's not particularly interested in the false moon, and just wants to figure out how to become immortal without going mad, and would be friends with us if he thought we'd have a better shot of conquering the tower than Adal Nacar, and we could make him think this by befriending at least one of the other scholars.

MEANWHILE

- Aethild goes to Fonsano to try to get some legionnaires to come to Moli to fight the spire cultists
- he gets kidnapped by some of Hortenza's men and lead to a barrow out of town where she's set up base
- she talks with Aethild and reveals her plan: to replicate the false moon and put a copy by every city, with the colour tuned to republican pride to inspire a state of permenant revolution
- Aethild seems on board and they discuss the tower cultist problem

interesting Hillkrem lore:

Hortenza suggests we lead the cultists up onto a big barrow-type thing south of Fonsano in order to ambush them by collapsing it. She stresses that if the ambush isn't successful, her men would flee safely and ours would probably get killed, and that she would be the first to ascend.

She sends a guy back with Aethild.

Aethild approaches the legionary in charge of Fonsano and immediately blabs about everything that just happened. The legion will remain in Fonsano to guard it and is going to ask around to figure out where Hortenza's guys are based and kill them all eventually once the logging guild thing is sorted.

He _then_ tells Hortenza's scout that actually the Legion knows about her already and will eventually send out guys to kill them all once the logging guild thing is sorted, and that they should therefore vacate their base and come to Moli. He is completely convinced by this, and reaches the only reasonable conclusion: there's a Nivish spy amongst the ranks of Hortenza's men. He suggests that they could set up a temporary base in abandoned buildings in a quarry a little north of Moli.

Aethild says something about the horse and the turtle, the well known fable, to try and dissuade the scout from dealing with the rat before coming to Moli, which has no effect.
