A trade ship leaves Nivena, loaded with valuable cargo and the arguably more valuable aristocrat Damian della Juno, guarded by his bodyguard Vitaly von Brom and the active battalion of the 72nd Century (which consists mostly of trainees). The ship is blown off course into shallow waters - Nivish trade ships typically stick to deeper waters to avoid the risk of running into Revic raiders.

A fleet of 12 longships leave the Marrow, each flying the flag of a different clan. They are bound to Duruza to attempt to negotiate a potential trade route between the two nations on behalf of the Marrowking. On their way, they encounter a trade ship blown off course, and several longships break formation to board it. The first to reach flies the flag of clan (hattie's clan), and their men stream onto the soon-to-be captured vessel.

They are met with some resistance, organised by Scipian Barbolan, commander of the Century, but the men are inexperienced and underprepared - it quickly becomes clear they could not fend off a single longship, let alone a dozen. (deryn) calls for a parley, demanding a duel with the Marrodic captain.

(hattie) steps onto the trade ship, and offers a compromise: in exchange for all goods on board, the ship would be taken to Duruza and sold, where all aboard would be safely escorted back to Nivina. (the della Juno), after some persuasion, agrees. The low-ranking soldiers who survived are stripped of their weapons and armour, and the fleet gained another ship.

---

Shortly after fleeing Mervil Manor, circling the estate to reach the road to Duruza, [[Astrid Knutsdir|Astrid]] met up with Aethild who, seeing the fight had already started and ended before he and his legionaries could intervene, had turned around and started walking back to the capital. The two reconcile and journey together, staying for several weeks as Astrid healed her wounds. (hags) found many jobs suitable for a baneman, more than enough to cover living expenses which included a barrel of mulled wine a week.

Having seen no advertisement of a ship bound for the Marrowlaw during their stay, the two sold their carriage to one Gnaesia Arcavo, a collector of antiquities who was very interested in its former owner, [[Karishna]]. (hags) describes her as a saint and recounts her death at the hand of a cursed ax - information which contradicted the official narrative, but when shown the weapon in question, along with Karisna's swish hands, Gnaesia parted with 10 silver (far more than market value) to buy the carriage and the ax. 

(hags) posts a notice that two people are willing to pay 5S each for passage to the Marrowlaw. A day later, a response, including a time and location for a meeting with the captain, is attached below, directing the pair to The Secret Basement, an upmarket dockside tavern. When they arrive, an underling hails them, and heads upstairs to fetch their captain. Coming down with them, however, is [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who apologies for what she describes as necessary deceit, as her father Duke [[Ludovic de Mervil]] has men hunting for her (and likely the party as well).

She informs them that her sister [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] has disappeared, almost certainly by her father's hand after her failed insurrection against him. She cannot trust him any longer, after he had [[Jovian Palantina|Saint Jovian]] executed, and fled the house after gathering all the valuables she could and driving the remaining guests staying on the Manor grounds into an uproar (after which they were all expelled).

She begs of what remains of the Companions of Knut to either arrange an audience with the empress, although she knows not what good this would do nor how they would achieve this; or to take her with them to the Marrowlaw such that she may cultivate power and one day return to secure her birthright.

---

A town crier takes their stand to inform the citizens of Duruza that a fleet of Revic ships would soon be arriving, and that, as they are part of a diplomatic mission and have no hostile intent, there is no reason to panic. Astrid pushes her way down to the docks, looking at the flags on the horizon for that of her own clan, Verkvarg. She does not find it, but among the familiar Marrodic clans she finds a flag of unknown design - a snake emerging from a horn - attached to a ship of unfamiliar make.

---

The fleet would not be using the civilian docks - the fortified harbour, part of the royal quarter, leads directly to the palace. With about half an hour until landfall, Astrid and Aethild make their way to the dockside gate, where almost everyone who spoke to the guards was turned away. Aethild claims to have work catching rats in the warehouses, hired specifically by Bertrand (the royal dong farmer with whom he had worked previously, establishing significant rapport). Bertrand is called to the gate and, without hesitation, plays along, eventually convincing the guards to let him, and his "assistant", pass.

Inside, Astrid finds an empty room to change into her fine clothes, and the two make their way to a makeshift viewing platform on the district walls, where various servants and minor nobles awaited the reception ceremony. Aethild claims to be taking care of Astrid, who, in her fine clothes, arouses no suspicion. 

Hearing that, after reception, there is to be a feast which one requires an invitation for, Aethild identifies a suitably inebriated noble and asks for his invitation - or failing that, to take Astrid as his plus-one. The noble, half Astrid's age, takes offence, claiming to have already invited a most beautiful woman. Aethild raises an eyebrow - the noble is obviously lying about this - and seeing he has been caught out, blusters and insults Aethild, who responds in kind. The noble, enraged, demands satisfaction, and makes enough commotion to attract the attention of a pair of nearby guards, who remind him that duelling is technically illegal, and this fact may be harder than usual to overlook today owing to the high-profile guests present. Aethild (or was it Astrid? i forget) pick the invitation from his pocket as they leave.

---

Praetorian guards in ceremonial bronze armour line all sides of the harbour. Most of the city watch has been drafted in to make up the numbers. Brago, the delegation from clan Virkvärg, derides that both the quantity and quality of the military has not changed since 30 years ago  

After the ships dock, 


- trumpets sound, a herald announces the arrival of the empress, who says a few words and then goes back inside
- the Basila's voice, a don Martolis, will be dealing with us day-to-day, but there will be an audience with the empress at some point
- most of the ceremonial guards start to march out and the clans line up to present their gifts. the don, who is receiving them, accepts them with grace, but to a trained eye it's all formality.
- Fatima presents her first gift, an ornate writing set, to much the same reaction, but also the captured dela Juno. the don considers for a moment, and then appears genuinely enthusiastic and grateful. Fatima also offers to sell the captured ship, with details to be negotiated at a later time.
- Fatima and the Virkvärgs begin to wander off, but Astrid and Aethild walk up to them and introduce themselves. Brago identifies Astrid as a cousin and asks how her pilgrimage was going, noting he thought it was an odd choice to transport the reliquary by foot.
- Since the reliquary is in the city, and it would be easiest to transport it back by boat given the opportunity has presented itself, and there is a little time before the feast begins, everyone heads to the inn Astrid was staying at to pick it up.
- Astrid, Fatima, and Brago head up to the room to admire the reliquary, while everyone else stays at the bar. After a time, Brago asks Fatima to leave so he may discuss politics with Astrid. Fatima stays a little way outside the door, such that she can hear anything said with a raised voice.
- Brago recounts the current political situation in Virkvärg:
	- After Jarl Knut's recent death, the clan informally split into two factions, each with their own candidate for Jarl. As of yet, no consensus has been reached, and there is fear that the situation may turn violent.
	- The accorder faction is a significant minority, and seem more aligned with Knut (who was also an accorder). But they deviate?
	- The other faction is notionally orod tast and i don't really remember much about them either
	- The two factions have generally irreconcilable stances on religion and the future of the clan
	- Brago suggests that, as someone not particularly affiliated with either side, a somewhat legitimate claim, and as the one who successfully returned the reliquary, he would be ideal as a ~~third competing standard~~ middle ground to unite the clan. He asks for Astrid's support, which would involve disregarding Knut's will, which is almost certainly too idealistic to be practical.
	- Astrid is unwilling to cede ground on this, and demands credit for transporting the reliquary and that the will is read out publicly upon its return. Brago is upset and attempts to open the reliquary by force to read the will.
- Hearing a commotion, Fatima re-enters the room and attempts to sort out a compromise - the will would be read here and, if reasonable, returned to the reliquary. Astrid insists the seal not be broken, and Brago, seeing this would not be resolved any other way, challenges her to a duel, to be carried out later tonight. The two agree and the reliquary is carried back to the boat by Aethid and Stell (Steirla, Brago's guard-with-a-cool-title). Aethid fails to flirt with Stell, who is extremely serious.
- Despite not understanding what anyone was saying, Scipian picks up that something is wrong and, confident in his fighting ability, offers to be Astrid's champion in exchange for his freedom. Fatima agrees, and Astrid buys him for a silver coin (very cheap, good deal)
- Also, the party picks up [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]] and gives her an invitation to the banquet, so that she might be able to plead her case to the empress. At the banquet, she's seen speaking to a member of staff and lead off somewhere (???) at which point we lose track of her. probably got disappeared.
- At the banquet, Astrid and Brago performatively ignore each other, and both gossip about their upcoming duel to try to win favour from the other clans. Aethild attempts to flirt with the crown princess Amoranta, but is prevented from getting close to their table and eventually thrown out entirely due to repeated attempts.
- At night, on Fatima's boat, we gather for the duel. Traditional rules allow for champions, with a few caveats: duels between champions are typically to the death, and a noble unsatisfied with the result has the right to fight the opposing noble and their surviving champion at the same time.
- The two stipulate conditions back and forth, eventually concluding the format: short-swords only, no armour, victory goes to first blood. Stell champions Brago, Scipian champions Astrid. Fatima, officiating, calls to begin combat.
- They prowl around each other in a half-circle for a moment, then Scipian lunges forward. Stell dodges and counters, and the two lose themselves in a whirl of parries, feints, footwork, riposte after riposte until a quick slash grazes Stell's arm and they both instinctively jump backwards.
- It's only a few drops of blood, but Astrid picks it up in the darkness and calls victory. Brago blusters something about first blood meaning injury, not literal just literal blood. Fatima agrees,  the sound of steel on steel and heavy breathing resumes.
- Stell lands a series of blows on Scipian's chest, arms, and leg, but none are deep enough to leave a scar, or call an end to the fight. Frustrated, Scipian swings wildly, trying to drive her back against the edge of the boat. She dodges backwards and counters, knocking the blade out of his hand. It clatters across the floor a few meters away. He reaches for her, as if going for a grapple, then punches her wrist at the last moment, throwing her weapon in the other direction.
- For a moment, silence, as they both calculate their next move - a mad dash back to their weapons, picking them up, and turning around to see Scipian mid-swing. She raises her hand to parry but too slow, he swerves the blade towards her and cuts off her hand. It falls to the ground, still clutching her sword. Bleeding, sweating, panting, Scipian raises his sword into the sky and screams.
- Brago, unsatisfied with the result of the duel, invokes his right to challange both the champion and their master at the same time. He downs Scipian and Astrid, and stands over Astrid gloating. Scipian gets up quietly and kills Brago while he's distracted. His other attendant tries to run and is also killed, and his body is dumped in the water. Brago's body is kept so it can be thrown into the ocean ceremonially.

---

Vitaly sends a letter to the dela Junos at a post office explaining roughly the situation, and that he'll be busy working for a different merchant company for a while. The clerk takes some interest in Damian's name.

As the sun rises, someone came into the room where Astrid and Scipian were resting, and lets Astrid know that her attendance at a meeting of jarls is not optional. Stell wakes up enough to offer some advice: clan Costoris (Toph) dont like brago but are fine with the house, but most other clans are going to be against her.

During the hearing, about five voices other than Varnoss speak out against Astrid. Ranvig hears the account of these events, from Astrid, Fatima, and cries from the other houses, and reaches a conclusion - the duel was conducted legitimately, but as a lower-ranking member than Brago, Astrid cannot be rewarded by killing a delegate, and therefore she should not replace him as a delegate (leaving Virkvarg unrepresented). Astrid contests that she is not of a lower rank, as the matter of succession is yet unresolved.

Toph, after a little prompting from Aethild, proposes that no further punishment is needed. Varnoss proposes the following: Astrid must kiss the ring, wear fealty to Varnoss, and they will read and then re-seal Knut's will (without publicly revealing the contents). Astrid accepts.

After, Aethild visits [[don Martolis]] to ask after [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who nobody had seen since last night's dinner. The don recounts his conversation, in which Criola appeared concerned and scared and requested to speak to the empress to raise a formal complaint against her own house, something which, while permitted, is quite unusual. He denied her request to speak immediately, as the empress is quite busy, but implied he had set a date for a hearing, and had sent a letter to don Mervil explaining the situation and requesting his presence. He asks if we know where Criola is, as he is concerned for her safety. Aethild glares at him, as that last part was obviously a lie, asserts that sending that letter has put Criola in danger, throws a glass of wine in his face, and runs away.

The party regroups and decides to head out to see Criola, with an aim to smuggle her back into the royal harbour and onto Fatima's boat. Cautious of the city watch patrolling behind them, they took a long and winding route to the tavern Astrid and co had been staying. On the way, an orphan ran up with a message, but says they need to do it in private, motioning to a nearby alley. Fearing a trap, Fatima gives the orphan (who's name was maizy) a gold coin to tell us now, as well as who she's working for, and she tells us that [[Meathead Ted]] is looking for us (so that he can rip our entrails out).

When the party arrived at the tavern they met with [[Serego of Matrica|Serego]], who provided a cryptic message apparently given to him by someone matching the description of [[Quintus]]:

> I'm not safe, i've left the SB, find me where the eagle finds it's nest. try the blue docks, and watch your purse.

Serego is fairly familiar with the blue docks, and guesses that the note might be referring to the Aery. We take him along with us, and eventually pass over a bridge going to the blue docks, which is next to the Kremish district. A guy smoking on the bridge look at us (who wouldn't, Fatima is in full armour and noble clothes). He slips away soon after we pass him. Vitaly buys a basket of cheese tarts from a street vendor.

We make it to the aery, a tavern with once-grand but now peeling paintwork, and meet up with Quintus again, who takes Astrid to Criola. She has given the crown princess a letter to give to the empress. She's going to stay in the mincemeat and ale afterwords, but the party concocts a plan to sneak her into the royal docks: bribing the guards. She accepts, packs up her things, and joins the party.

Meanwhile, down in the bar, a dog comes up to Scipian and Vitaly, apparently interested in the cheese rolls. The two feed the dog, and it licks their hands. Astrid thinks there's something weird about the dog. Someone kicks it so hard it starts bleeing from the ears and it runs out of the tavern. Astrid asks Scipian to follow it, which he does, into an alleyway where there's a bloodstain quite high up a wall next to a rent between two houses. Scipian theorises that if the dog was a shapeshifter, it might have left the stain while reverting to human form.

He tries to vault up into the rent, but something distinctly human bites his hands and he falls back down, and heads back to the rest of the party, who are heading back to the boat. On the way they see a guard patrol and duck into a nearby alley to let them pass. Everyone is a bit tired and let Serego lead for about 10 minutes, until they realise that he's leading them through a series of alleyways that head into the Kremish district, which is clearly undesirable. We backtrack, but find the way out blocked by a cart in a T-junction within the alley, with the sounds of an argument nearby from the other side.

We try to get past, with some people slipping past the back, and Scipian climbing over the top. The man having an argument yells at Scipian as he climbs over - he has a crossbow pointed at him, and it appears he was having the argument on his own. Scipian blusters for a bit, giving Fatima, Jovian, Serego, and Criola enough time to get to the other side, but a gang of Krems lead by the lady who sold Jovian those cheese rolls (and also [[Meathead Ted]]) arrive behind the rest of the party, trapping them with the wagon at their back.

The lady explains that Meathead Ted is looking for revenge for his friends, who were killed for associating with [[Jan the Jagged]] by the [[Companions of Knut]]. Astrid points out that that party has almost completely dissolved, and [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]], who did most of the killing, died and is now a freshwater spring, and [[Poleman]] is in [[Luruna]] somewhere.

Ted suggests he's already dealt with Poleman, and that he's going to kill Astrid now. Scipian (on behalf of everyone else) asks if he can leave, since he doesn't really have anything to do with this grudge, and with the cheese lady's approval everyone who'd got past the cart heads out, leaving Astrid and Quintus behind. By some stroke of luck, the cart unwedges itself and crashes into a wall, exploding flour everywhere at exactly the same time as Quintus charges into the gang. Astrid runs away to the sounds of several different people screaming in pain.

Everyone (other than Quintus) make it back safely to the royal docks. The guards ask who Criola is, as there's paperwork they need to fill in, and Fatima starts counting coins. After a moment, the guards agree that maybe paperwork isn't needed in this instance, requiring only 6 bronze between them. Once out of earshot, Criola is appalled that the guards have fallen so far as to accept bribes, and Scipian is appalled both that Fatima had been counting *bronze*, and that the guards had accepted been so cheap as to accept them.

Talia, 2nd of Autumn
moon: thin cresent, barely visible. waxing.

Fatima, Scipian, and Astrid went to a meeting about selling the trade ship. Representing the empire is the don and admiral Marcan Mimori (a member of his family has married into the Marsallases). They initially offer 30 silver, and Fatima haggles them up to 50 for the ship and a monopsony on the cargo. An inspection is arranged for Harla 2nd, two days from now.

Fatima's retainer picks the lock on Damian's lockbox, hoping to find the ship's manifest to determine the value of the cargo. The contents are underwhelming - low-grade iron ore, timber, clothing, and a single crate of two-dozen nivish longbows. Also in the box is a coat, a fine compass which Fatima takes, and series of personal letters which Fatima also takes.

In one of the letters, Martala (? a relative of Damian?) writes to Damian della Juno about the commission and why the he's going on this boat, about his favourite prostitute, and then there's a block of text that's completely indecipherable. Fatima gets Criola to try to crack it, and also takes a copy for herself.

Stell and Astrid have a private conversation in another room. She hopes to die in service of a noble cause, and requests a purpose from Astrid, who says she aims to take the throne of Virkvärg at risk of her own life, but not that of her family. Stell outlines the situation and offers her advice: [[Stell's Advice]]

Astrid gets stopped outside her room by Ranvig's huscarl, who is here to collect the will. Astrid and Aethild head out to the boat where the reliquary is, and note that there are two lights on, one on both of Fatima's boats. Fatima asks about the nivish code she's looking at, the huskal suggests that maybe someone in duruza could help. They open the reliquary and take the will and take it to ranvig.

Notes on [[Ranvig reading the will]] are on a different page in case you want to be left in suspense.

Mara 2nd of autumn, 172

Serego smuggles some grapes to Criola for breakfast, and asks for us to retrieve his stuff from the tavern and to tell his patients that he's indisposed. Aethild heads out on his own, but picks up Folvin the haughty courtier. He picks up the stuff and then heads to a courier (Sinoli and Son) to have them tell everyone. He haggles them down from 4B to 3B to 4B to zero, and then back up to 2B. 

They head back to the palace and Folvin whispers something to the guards and they act a little taken aback and let him through. Aethild takes him back to his room, and then breaks down crying and falls asleep. We learn that Don Marion Matolis's son, Vespin, had a dalliance with Folvin. Folvin had to escape out a window and broke his tibia.

Fatima returns to her room to find the door unlocked. The room is tidy, but all of her notes have been stolen.

---

hattie meeting one: joint ownership shipping lane between stravan and duruza. it's wool.


aethild animates [[Karishna]]'s right hand to find the person who stole all of fatima's stuff. It runs out of the room and down the corridoor, and down the stairs. Astrid falls over the stairs and grabs the banister, but trips Scipian up as he follows. It heads down, down, and down another set of stairs to the basement/servent's zone.

A few servents see us. Scipian barges past and Aethild invoke's Bertrand's name which allows the rest of them to get buy. The hand leads us to a door with a nameplate: "Lenora". Aethild doubles back to fetch Fatima, and once everyone has grouped up we bang on the door.

Apparantly she thought no-one was staying in the room and thought the documents might be relevant to the house, so brought them to the Majordomo. Everyone believes her for some reason, and we go see her boss, who retrieves the documents from a safe. They've been rebound, apparently by a scribe who spoke the languages(s) they were written in, who has since gone on leave.

Aethild attempts to slip a silver coin into Lenora's bag, and finds a scrapbook open with impressions of revic symbols. The party asks to take Lenora with us, and the Majordomo permits this (presuming that we'll be punishing her for her mistake somehow).

We exit out of the upper entrance to their office into a courtyard. Aethild, and a little bit of the others, break her down and she admits to taking them intentionally to copy some of the text in order to teach herself revic, as she wanted to send a letter to an estranged revic family member. Seeing she meant no harm, Fatima offers to translate and deliver her letter.

We go back to the boat to try to find the secret things. Scipian uses his Nivish intuition to determine there's probably some stuff hidden in a secret compartment, and Astrid uses her carpenter's intuition to determine where it is. There's a bag containing about 14 silver in various currencies, various daggers in varying sizes, and lots of face coverings in various types.

Fatima goes to her meeting. It's about joint ownership of a shipping lane between stravan and duruza, trading wool. She negotiates an extremely favourable deal, gaining a 1 (i think?) year monopoly on the wool supplied, with the expectation that it would be renewed if everything went well.

After a bit, a guard comes up to Astrid, Scipian, and Aethid, and says someone's at the guard house looking for us by the name of Quintus. He seems quite hurt. Aethild attempts to inspect his wound under the guise of treating it, but Quintus doesn't want it to be accidentally reopened. Aethild touches his hand as part of this, and it's stone cold.

Zombie Quintus lunges at Astrid and puts her in a chokehold. Scipian tries to pull his arms away but they're superhumanly strong. Aethild starts to draw a circle around him to banish the spirit possessing him. Scipian hacks off one of the arms, allowing Astrid to get a few breaths in, and then the circle is completed, Aethild recites a poem, and the body drops to the floor. Guards come in and ask some questions, bring a mortician who confirms that the body was dead before it came in, and let us go.

Another visitor at the other gate - it's [[Aulani Lavinia de Mervil]] asking us where Criola is. She updates us on the Mervil situation - [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] is dead, presumably killed by her father (although Lavinia obviously doesn't admit anything, even when read), and the Don [[Ludovic de Mervil]] has taken ill with a flare up of stress-induced rheumatism. The party denies knowing where Criola is, and says that she's been hopping between taverns to avoid being found.

The party briefly splits, with Scipian heading in the direction of the docks (although that way also lead to much of the city). Fatima notices that he's being followed, and catches up to ask for his help with something else instead.

Aethid never met with Lavinia, and instead went directly to the boat after hearing that a noble had arrived, assuming that it Lavinia. He told Criola to keep a low profile, eg not using a candle, and was given a shopping list.

Fatima decides that she wants to kill and eat Criola, to ensure that she is never captured.

---

Aethild goes around the palace to get supplies for criola. A servant is looking at him in a knowing way, but hurries off when he gets noticed. He notices another figure looking at him from a first-floor window as he returns to the ship.

Vitaly socialises with the guards/servants and does some light gambling and talks about whale meat. Apparently the Marsvinn are plotting against Astrid. Fatima with Vitaly head to the Primafora in the Wens to get a new cloak and 22S worth of Valiant-Empire-themed jewellery.

Vitaly gets a kebab and gives a bit of it to a dog. It licks some sauce off his hands. It doesn't look similar to the dog we saw in The Aery. The dog follows Vitaly for a while, but then stops raises its hackles, and starts barking at an alleyway. Fatima notices a rustle of movement behind a stack of crates halfway down the alley, but it quickly moves out of sight. Vitaly picks up the dog - it doesn't resist, but continues to stare at the alley.

A guard notes that the dog is the same breed used by the legion, and that if fed up enough it could be a reliable companion. They especially highlight the keen sense of smell.

Astrid goes to the baths to meet with Toph, and learns that the boats for the whale hunt will be leaving early and those who wanted to do well should avoid drinking too much at the feast.

Aethild goes around smearing fish entrails on the boats to attract whales. A speaker tells her that only the boats from clans Castoras, Marvur, and Varnoss will be used in the hunt. The participants will be split into three teams - only those of renown will be allowed, so more housecarls will be needed to crew the ships (ie not galley thralls). Ranvig is displeased at the lack of unity after Brago's death, and wishes to reform bonds between the clans. She complains at the increased boldness of the inquisition, and says she'll be aiming to show the superiority of the old ways. Aethild asks her to set a spirit to ward the boat, and she does so for 4S. Odbjorg.

Marsvin are one of two clans to serve directly under Varnoss, being in higher esteem to the other six.

Hrodgir (jarl deligate of Marsvin) and Thrudvedir (nephew of the jarl of clan vedir) are quiet and reserved, and occasionally cast a glance towards fatima and astrid.

Vitaly chats up a twink chronicler, and they head off into the hedge maze to drink. Aethild carrouses with some housecarls, telling them stories about his times as a baneman. He arm wrestles one of them after they accuse him of lying, and wins. She leaves to "freshen up" and Scipian subtly follows her.

Throdvedir excuses himself, and fatima discerns that he has ulterior motives and doesn't like astrid. Ranvig calls for axes and the meat to be brought in, and the servants carry through an entire roast boar. One can have as much meat as they shave off by throwing an axe at it. Toph gives Astrid some advice, and astrid hits first the snout, and then a good cut of back bacon.

Fatima notices that astrid's meat was prepared using a smaller separate pot of gravy, and calls throdgir out for poisoning her food - suggesting that there's a tradition of eating food from one another's plate as a mean of reconciliation. He refuses, claiming he's feeling ill.

Meanwhile, scipian gets caught sneaking around in the house by Throdvedir, who offers him 12S in rings to betray astrid and lead her towards a door where she is to be assassinated.

---

During the night, the bald man who had been seen following the party earlier tried to sneak onto the ship, and was killed by the spirit. He appeared unhurt except for clawing at his neck, as if he was unable to breath. He wore servents clothing, and thin shoes designed to make little noise, and carried a single long dagger of good make. He has iron ore tied to his legs and is dumped into the water.

Aethild makes an attempt to check if the dog is a shapeshifter at Scipian's behest, and concludes that it is not. He heads out to the wens to try to reserve two spots for the party's boats. Scipian heads out to buy various supplies.

A boat with the flag of a porpoise, clan Marsvin's, is seen heading directly towards the Luca Lenna. Fatima orders everyone to prepare for combat. His crew are unarmed and unarmoured. Hrodgir hails, asking to talk to Astrid. He boards the ship alone, and conveys that:

- He respects Astrid for her ability to project her will
- The aim of the plot wasn't to kill Astrid but to force her to duel him 1-on-1
- He'd like for her to get Thrudvedir off in exchange for tribute from him of 25S and 10 galley thralls.

Astrid accepts, and he gives her a single silver, which, in addition to the rings we looted from Thrudvedir's body, amounts to 25S. Astrid, embarrassed, imagines Hrodgir's plank breaking as he returns to his ship, and by some stroke of luck this transpires exactly. A speaker from his boat calms the water around him, and stares coldly at Astrid. She returns a cheeky smile, and feels a cold grip around her neck. Hrodgir's boat sails off to rejoin the wale hunt.

Astrid goes back to the palace and gets Ranvig to spare the guy because he says he's not gonna try to kill her again. We collect the thralls, as well as the axe he would have used to duel her.

Aethild goes around the dockside taverns, asking the barkeeps to put up notices that we're looking for crew. We interview 6 people and hire 5, at a rate of 2B/day each for a 5 day journey (1S per crew member).

- cecil linion of duruza. Knows how to do ropemaking and sails. Pleasant, professional, and forthright. Aethild clocks him as gay and flits a bit. Apparently kremish.
- Burly man with a cropped beard. hairy guy. Aiba. Experienced quartermaster. Has killed people before.
- guy with an eyepatch, scars, and three silver teeth. carries a dagger at his belt. ears pierced. From Skelverthon, in the sea of shades. Aethild gets a bad vibe from this guy and denies him.
- woman with long curly GOLDEN hair, covered in sailor's tatoos. Nesta Krid. Mostly experience fishing. Is kremish, and was approached by someone representing the dewis and offered triple what we're paying. She admits this freely and says she doesn't like them as she worships the ideal lodges. Girlboss.
- average man, bit of a receding hairline 22 years old. 5 foot 7. Anato (nat). Mixed experience, 15 years. Seems a little dim.

Fatima heads off for the trade meeting in the home of a wealthy merchant within the royal quater, taking Aethild and Vitaly with her. Once inside, don lipesa (one of princess Amaranthine's handmaidens) approaches them with a message for Astrid stamped with the royal seal. The messanger asks that it's delivered to criola, and fatima reflexively agrees. There's something heavy and metalic inside the scroll case, and the messanger, as she leaves, insists that "this is for her eyes only". Fatima suspects it may be a bomb.

Don Martolis hates Aethild, but is forced to let him into the negotiations anyway. He doesn't seem to care about the message Aethild is holding. The merchant is shrewd and intelligent, and gets along well with Fatima, finding many places where their interests align and deals can be made.

After the meeting, Don Martolis asks Fatima on a walk to discuss something. He suggests that he'd be willing to return the previous crew of the Luca Lenna in exchange for a minor holding fee. This immediately strikes Fatima as weird, as slave trading is banned in Duruza. Fatima presses him on this, and he asserts that he (on behalf of the empress) wishes to build goodwill with the trade delegation.

Fatima and Aethild discuss torturing and/or thralling the crew, since they assume that this is part of some kind of scheme, but ultimately chose not to take the deal. He passes on a message from Lavinia, requesting Astrid comes to speak with her.

everyone spends a long time working around the letter maybe being a bomb, and it's eventually opened and it seems fine. Aethild fucks up and drops everything on the floor and it all scatters everywhere. Someone steps on the end of the letter and get a bootprint on it, Scipian dives to catch some fine rings before they fall through the floorboards, and Aethid gets a big gold amulet of imperial favour.

Aethild does some dumb bullshit and gets arrested, gets taken to Lavinia because she's the only noble that he can think of. Lavinia, once they're alone, asks to speak in private but when aethild says he's gonna leave she admits that the party is going to be killed by [[Bjarni's Blood Brothers]] because her organisation ordered them to. Aethid throws some dust in her face and runs off.

everyone gets mad and shouts at each other. Scipian is too angry to write this segment.

Ranvig has a history with Bjarni, and wants him dead for the sake of peace. She agrees to supply [[Odbjorg]], a speaker from clan Veder she had been thinking of taking for herself. Odbjorg dislikes Astrid for using magic dishonourably.

everyone agrees that after the battle Aethild will be tied to the mast and flogged, likely by the speaker, until they go insane.


---

Aethild's flogging didnt make him go insane.

The crew report a ghost in the cargo hold. Party goes in and find the ghost - the gaunt, white, shambling remains of [[Meathead Ted]], in the last stages of shade rot. Astrid kills him with javelins, and the body is rolled into a tarp and thrown overboard by Sterla and Seingrim, who are then quarantined in a cabin.

The party gathers in Aeithild's room, and find Hodly Gala listening at the door. He reveals, under duress, that he was forced to smuggle two people aboard by a dewis in exchange for 5s. He is locked in the cargo hold until he finds and kills the other stowaway. He fails to do this within the alloted time (approx 5 hours) and is hauled out over the side of the ship, hanged, and stoned to death by the sailors for bringing the plague.

On the third day (M3) [[Bjarni's Blood Brothers]] are sighted, and it's noted that the oars seem to be rowing on their own. Odbjorg uses magic to speed up the boat, and we eventually lose sight of them.

- astrid takes Sterla and Steingrim back down into the hold and shoots some rats with a crossbow. it is later revealed that the dewis, who is hiding in the cargo hold, was possessing them at the time.
- she then rearranges all the food into a pile by the entrance, working into the night. Steingrim goes to bed, but Sterla interprets a "do what you want" kind of instruction as "work yourself to death" and then does that. After a few hours, Astrid notices that Sterla has collapsed and is coughing, which they both recognise. Sterla offers to kill herself, but astrid says to wait until morning.
- In the morning, her body has been moved and her throat cut. She's possessed, much like Quintus (and the rats, which apparently took a while to prepare) and attacks astrid, biting her shoulder in the fight. She calls for help and Aethild and Aiba bash the body to death. Someone remembers that umbrum can prevent someone from leaving a body they have possessed, but no-one has any at the time.
	- it seems likely that the dewis attempted to kill Astrid while she was asleep but was fought off by Stell.
- astrid miscasts a spell during the fight causing [[Bjarni's Blood Brothers]] to appear ahead of the ships. Everyone prepares for combat, although it's still possible to avoid them (at the cost of a considerable detour which we may not have supplies for).

- we figure it's probably best to fight them now and get it over with
- the Seagull, captained by Scipian, tries to ride ahead of the enemy ship to encircle it, while the Lucalenna, captained by Fatima, holds back for a time and then attempts a high-speed ram with wind provided by Odbjorg.
- The enemy ship is magic and rows itself, and the oars move with inhuman speed and unity allowing the boat to be far more agile than it otherwise would
	- it keeps pace with the Seagull and Lucalenna consistently, preventing any ramming or encirclement
- Bjarni is confident a giant eel will arrive soon, and successfully stalls until it appears, knocking the Seagul off course and eating/injuring/scaring the crew. Aethild recognises that giant eels are weak to thunder and asks Odbjorg to make some, and everyone gets down from the rigging to hide since there's not much wind without her and they keep getting shot down anyway
	- no-one actually knows where the eel came from - you cant summon eels with speaker magic and there wasn't even a real speaker on their ship anyway
- the eel is hit by several surprisingly accurate barrages of harpoons, and is finished off/scared away by the eventual thunder
- meanwhile on the enemy ship, Halfdan leads a mutiny against Bjarni, citing "he's taking too many shares", "we don't even do raiding any more", and "this ship is an affront to nature" as the primary reasons. Most people are swayed by this, and are even more swayed when Halfdan quickly kills Bjarni in 1-1 combat.
- A storm opens up above the ship, and lightning strikes directly where Halfdan is standing. Almost everyone other than Halfdan dodges away, but his arm is badly burned. Shortly after, the head of the ship erupts into flame, destroying the bindings which kept the spirit which rowed the oars contained.
- since the ship is now on fire and the eel is dead, the Blood Brothers de facto surrender unconditionally and try to swim towards the Lucalenna. Many die in the stormy water, but 7 make it aboard (and promptly chained and taken as thralls), notably including:
	- Halfdan, 30, leader of the munineers
	- Leif, Halfdan's sister (same age, not related by blood)
	- Luther, Nivish mad scientist and noted non-speaker who is researching methods to harness the spirits against their will

Later, Halfdan visits Odbjorg to get her opinion on Luther and to ask about a vision that he had (no-one else knows about the vision). She reports that:
- the spirits aren't sacred so she has no particular opinion on what Luther is doing, but he's a fool if he thinks he can abuse them and get away with it
- Halfdan could become a speaker if he was given the right training, and he absolutely should not try to do so without training. she gives him an address halfway up a mountain somewhere.

Fatima moves over to the Seagul, as it has more food and no plague. Astrid spots someone talking to someone else in a way that indicated they were planning a mutiny. It is mused that Iber's presence topdeck was having a soothing effect on the crew.

Great Uncle Tibretto Bearlover the Trickster, the chef on the Death's Handmaiden (captured but unable to be enthralled due to being an Usling) suggests using the bodies of the dead to attract sharks, which could be used as food. Fearing a mutiny due to the limited rations, the plan is followed, but no sharks bite during the limited amount of daylight remaining. The rest of the bodies are covered in above-deck hammocks, so they can be used as bait tomorrow morning.

Nashta 3rd

The morning's shark hunt was a great success! Someone suggested trailing the rowboats behind the ship (as it would be much easier to hit the sharks from a vantage point which could stop moving within a moment), and a great haul of two sharks was brought back to the ship, which should do a great deal for morale. The inedible parts can be thrown back into the water as more chum to catch more sharks, with any luck.

Smooth sailing otherwise.

During the night, a minor commotion - someone was knocking on the door to the brig. Suspecting it was one of the mutineers trying to recruit Halfdan and his friend (which would make sense, as they've already been in one mutiny recently), Astrid confronts them and loudly denounces the idea of mutiny as suicide: anyone fleeing the boat this far out to sea would surely die, and there's enough rooms the sick can be safely quarantined without infecting the rest of the crew. She then has tea with Tibretto, who has spent much of the night making some kind of head-ware he claims protects against plagues. Perhaps this is some nivish technology I've not heard of?

Talia 5th

Quarantine at Stravan passed uneventfully. Some kind of power struggle going on in the city and they don't let us dock. We don't get involved and trade our bulk goods for supplies.

Fatima spends an entire guilder repairing the ship and hiring a loyal and skilled crew, far more than needed but she's taking no risks.

Taliad 7:13 (actual) - the Learned man thus humbled, bowed before the Elect, yet the Feckless one ceased not his offensive prattle: "if thy invested authority truly exceedeth that of a mighty Gens, then the sword of divine justice must cut swifter than that of Eromeus' executioner!"
Nashtunad 7:13 - "And also from Ithyra came from the merchant Teodorik, bearing 15 Rings fit for a prince"
