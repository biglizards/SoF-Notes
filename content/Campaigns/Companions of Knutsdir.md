A trade ship leaves Nivena, loaded with valuable cargo and the arguably more valuable aristocrat Damian della Juno, guarded by his bodyguard (deryn's character) and the active battalion of the 72nd Century (which consists mostly of trainees). The ship is blown off course into shallow waters - Nivish trade ships typically stick to deeper waters to avoid the risk of running into Revic raiders.

A fleet of 12 longships leave the Marrow, each flying the flag of a different clan. They are bound to Duruza to attempt to negotiate a potential trade route between the two nations on behalf of the Marrowking. On their way, they encounter a trade ship blown off course, and several longships break formation to board it. The first to reach flies the flag of clan (hattie's clan), and their men stream onto the soon-to-be captured vessel.

They are met with some resistance, organised by Scipian Barbolan, commander of the Century, but the men are inexperienced and underprepared - it quickly becomes clear they could not fend off a single longship, let alone a dozen. (deryn) calls for a parley, demanding a duel with the Marrodic captain.

(hattie) steps onto the trade ship, and offers a compromise: in exchange for all goods on board, the ship would be taken to Duruza and sold, where all aboard would be safely escorted back to Nivina. (the della Juno), after some persuasion, agrees. The low-ranking soldiers who survived are stripped of their weapons and armour, and the fleet gained another ship.

Shortly after fleeing Mervil Manor, circling the estate to reach the road to Duruza, [[Astrid Knutsdir|Astrid]] met up with Aethild who, seeing the fight had already started and ended before he and his legionaries could intervene, had turned around and started walking back to the capital. The two reconcile and journey together, staying for several weeks as Astrid healed her wounds. (hags) found many jobs suitable for a baneman, more than enough to cover living expenses which included a barrel of mulled wine a week.

Having seen no advertisement of a ship bound for the Marrowlaw during their stay, the two sold their carriage to one Gnaesia Arcavo, a collector of antiquities who was very interested in its former owner, [[Karishna]]. (hags) describes her as a saint and recounts her death at the hand of a cursed ax - information which contradicted the official narrative, but when shown the weapon in question, along with Karisna's swish hands, Gnaesia parted with 10 silver (far more than market value) to buy the carriage and the ax. 

(hags) posts a notice that two people are willing to pay 5S each for passage to the Marrowlaw. A day later, a response, including a time and location for a meeting with the captain, is attached below, directing the pair to The Secret Basement, an upmarket dockside tavern. When they arrive, an underling hails them, and heads upstairs to fetch their captain. Coming down with them, however, is [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who apologies for what she describes as necessary deceit, as her father Duke [[Ludovic de Mervil]] has men hunting for her (and likely the party as well).

She informs them that her sister [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] has disappeared, almost certainly by her father's hand after her failed insurrection against him. She cannot trust him any longer, after he had [[Jovian Palantina|Saint Jovian]] executed, and fled the house after gathering all the valuables she could and driving the remaining guests staying on the Manor grounds into an uproar (after which they were all expelled).

She begs of what remains of the Companions of Knut to either arrange an audience with the empress, although she knows not what good this would do nor how they would achieve this; or to take her with them to the Marrowlaw such that she may cultivate power and one day return to secure her birthright.

---

A town crier takes their stand to inform the citizens of Duruza that a fleet of Revic ships would soon be arriving, and that, as they are part of a diplomatic mission and have no hostile intent, there is no reason to panic. Astrid pushes her way down to the docks, looking at the flags on the horizon for that of her own clan, Verkvarg. She does not find it, but among the familiar Marrodic clans she finds a flag of unknown design - a snake emerging from a horn - attached to a ship of unfamiliar make.

---

The fleet would not be using the civilian docks - the fortified harbour, part of the royal quarter, leads directly to the palace. With about half an hour until landfall, Astrid and Aethild make their way to the dockside gate, where almost everyone who spoke to the guards was turned away. Aethild claims to have work catching rats in the warehouses, hired specifically by Bertrand (the royal dong farmer with whom he had worked previously, establishing significant rapport). Bertrand is called to the gate and, without hesitation, plays along, eventually convincing the guards to let him, and his "assistant", pass.

Inside, Astrid finds an empty room to change into her fine clothes, and the two make their way to a makeshift viewing platform on the district walls, where various servants and minor nobles awaited the reception ceremony. Aethild claims to be taking care of Astrid, who, in her fine clothes, arouses no suspicion. 

Hearing that, after reception, there is to be a feast which one requires an invitation for, Aethild identifies a suitably inebriated noble and asks for his invitation - or failing that, to take Astrid as his plus-one. The noble, half Astrid's age, takes offence, claiming to have already invited a most beautiful woman. Aethild raises an eyebrow - the noble is obviously lying about this - and seeing he has been caught out, blusters and insults Aethild, who responds in kind. The noble, enraged, demands satisfaction, and makes enough commotion to attract the attention of a pair of nearby guards, who remind him that duelling is technically illegal, and this fact may be harder than usual to overlook today owing to the high-profile guests present. Aethild (or was it Astrid? i forget) pick the invitation from his pocket as they leave.

---

Praetorian guards in ceremonial bronze armour line all sides of the harbour. Most of the city watch has been drafted in to make up the numbers. Brago, the delegation from clan Virkvärg, derides that both the quantity and quality of the military has not changed since 30 years ago  

After the ships dock, 


- trumpets sound, a herald announces the arrival of the empress, who says a few words and then goes back inside
- the Basila's voice, a don Martolis, will be dealing with us day-to-day, but there will be an audience with the empress at some point
- most of the ceremonial guards start to march out and the clans line up to present their gifts. the don, who is receiving them, accepts them with grace, but to a trained eye it's all formality.
- Fatima presents her first gift, an ornate writing set, to much the same reaction, but also the captured dela Juno. the don considers for a moment, and then appears genuinely enthusiastic and grateful. Fatima also offers to sell the captured ship, with details to be negotiated at a later time.
- Fatima and the Virkvärgs begin to wander off, but Astrid and Aethild walk up to them and introduce themselves. Brago identifies Astrid as a cousin and asks how her pilgrimage was going, noting he thought it was an odd choice to transport the reliquary by foot.
- Since the reliquary is in the city, and it would be easiest to transport it back by boat given the opportunity has presented itself, and there is a little time before the feast begins, everyone heads to the inn Astrid was staying at to pick it up.
- Astrid, Fatima, and Brago head up to the room to admire the reliquary, while everyone else stays at the bar. After a time, Brago asks Fatima to leave so he may discuss politics with Astrid. Fatima stays a little way outside the door, such that she can hear anything said with a raised voice.
- Brago recounts the current political situation in Virkvärg:
	- After Jarl Knut's recent death, the clan informally split into two factions, each with their own candidate for Jarl. As of yet, no consensus has been reached, and there is fear that the situation may turn violent.
	- The accorder faction is a significant minority, and seem more aligned with Knut (who was also an accorder). But they deviate?
	- The other faction is notionally orod tast and i don't really remember much about them either
	- The two factions have generally irreconcilable stances on religion and the future of the clan
	- Brago suggests that, as someone not particularly affiliated with either side, a somewhat legitimate claim, and as the one who successfully returned the reliquary, he would be ideal as a ~~third competing standard~~ middle ground to unite the clan. He asks for Astrid's support, which would involve disregarding Knut's will, which is almost certainly too idealistic to be practical.
	- Astrid is unwilling to cede ground on this, and demands credit for transporting the reliquary and that the will is read out publicly upon its return. Brago is upset and attempts to open the reliquary by force to read the will.
- Hearing a commotion, Fatima re-enters the room and attempts to sort out a compromise - the will would be read here and, if reasonable, returned to the reliquary. Astrid insists the seal not be broken, and Brago, seeing this would not be resolved any other way, challenges her to a duel, to be carried out later tonight. The two agree and the reliquary is carried back to the boat by Aethid and Stell (Steirla, Brago's guard-with-a-cool-title). Aethid fails to flirt with Stell, who is extremely serious.
- Despite not understanding what anyone was saying, Scipian picks up that something is wrong and, confident in his fighting ability, offers to be Astrid's champion in exchange for his freedom. Fatima agrees, and Astrid buys him for a silver coin (very cheap, good deal)
- Also, the party picks up [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]] and gives her an invitation to the banquet, so that she might be able to plead her case to the empress. At the banquet, she's seen speaking to a member of staff and lead off somewhere (???) at which point we lose track of her. probably got disappeared.
- At the banquet, Astrid and Brago performatively ignore each other, and both gossip about their upcoming duel to try to win favour from the other clans. Aethild attempts to flirt with the crown princess Amoranta, but is prevented from getting close to their table and eventually thrown out entirely due to repeated attempts.
- At night, on Fatima's boat, we gather for the duel. Traditional rules allow for champions, with a few caveats: duels between champions are typically to the death, and a noble unsatisfied with the result has the right to fight the opposing noble and their surviving champion at the same time.
- The two stipulate conditions back and forth, eventually concluding the format: short-swords only, no armour, victory goes to first blood. Stell champions Brago, Scipian champions Astrid. Fatima, officiating, calls to begin combat.
- They prowl around each other in a half-circle for a moment, then Scipian lunges forward. Stell dodges and counters, and the two lose themselves in a whirl of parries, feints, footwork, riposte after riposte until a quick slash grazes Stell's arm and they both instinctively jump backwards.
- It's only a few drops of blood, but Astrid picks it up in the darkness and calls victory. Brago blusters something about first blood meaning injury, not literal just literal blood. Fatima agrees,  the sound of steel on steel and heavy breathing resumes.
- Stell lands a series of blows on Scipian's chest, arms, and leg, but none are deep enough to leave a scar, or call an end to the fight. Frustrated, Scipian swings wildly, trying to drive her back against the edge of the boat. She dodges backwards and counters, knocking the blade out of his hand. It clatters across the floor a few meters away. He reaches for her, as if going for a grapple, then punches her wrist at the last moment, throwing her weapon in the other direction.
- For a moment, silence, as they both calculate their next move - a mad dash back to their weapons, picking them up, and turning around to see Scipian mid-swing. She raises her hand to parry but too slow, he swerves the blade towards her and cuts off her hand. It falls to the ground, still clutching her sword. Bleeding, sweating, panting, Scipian raises his sword into the sky and screams.


---

Vitaly sends a letter to the dela Junos at a post office explaining roughly the situation, and that he'll be busy working for a different merchant company for a while. The clerk takes some interest in Damian's name.

As the sun rises, someone came into the room where Astrid and Scipian were resting, and lets Astrid know that her attendance at a meeting of jarls is not optional. Stell wakes up enough to offer some advice: clan Costoris (Toph) dont like brago but are fine with the house, but most other clans are going to be against her.

During the hearing, about five voices other than Varnoss speak out against Astrid. Ranvig hears the account of these events, from Astrid, Fatima, and cries from the other houses, and reaches a conclusion - the duel was conducted legitimately, but as a lower-ranking member than Brago, Astrid cannot be rewarded by killing a delegate, and therefore she should not replace him as a delegate (leaving Virkvarg unrepresented). Astrid contests that she is not of a lower rank, as the matter of succession is yet unresolved.

Toph, after a little prompting from Aethild, proposes that no further punishment is needed. Varnoss proposes the following: Astrid must kiss the ring, wear fealty to Varnoss, and they will read and then re-seal Knut's will (without publicly revealing the contents). Astrid accepts.

After, Aethild visits [[don Martolis]] to ask after [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who nobody had seen since last night's dinner. The don recounts his conversation, in which Criola appeared concerned and scared and requested to speak to the empress to raise a formal complaint against her own house, something which, while permitted, is quite unusual. He denied her request to speak immediately, as the empress is quite busy, but implied he had set a date for a hearing, and had sent a letter to don Mervil explaining the situation and requesting his presence. He asks if we know where Criola is, as he is concerned for her safety. Aethild glares at him, as that last part was obviously a lie, asserts that sending that letter has put Criola in danger, throws a glass of wine in his face, and runs away.

The party regroups and decides to head out to see Criola, with an aim to smuggle her back into the royal harbour and onto Fatima's boat. Cautious of the city watch patrolling behind them, they took a long and winding route to the tavern Astrid and co had been staying. On the way, an orphan ran up with a message, but says they need to do it in private, motioning to a nearby alley. Fearing a trap, Fatima gives the orphan (who's name was maizy) a gold coin to tell us now, as well as who she's working for, and she tells us that [[Meathead Ted]] is looking for us (so that he can rip our entrails out).

When the party arrived at the tavern they met with [[Serego of Matrica|Serego]], who provided a cryptic message apparently given to him by someone matching the description of [[Quintus]]:

> I'm not safe, i've left the SB, find me where the eagle finds it's nest. try the blue docks, and watch your purse.

Serego is fairly familiar with the blue docks, and guesses that the note might be referring to the Aery. We take him along with us, and eventually pass over a bridge going to the blue docks, which is next to the Kremish district. A guy smoking on the bridge look at us (who wouldn't, Fatima is in full armour and noble clothes). He slips away soon after we pass him. Vitaly buys a basket of cheese tarts from a street vendor.

We make it to the aery, a tavern with once-grand but now peeling paintwork, and meet up with Quintus again, who takes Astrid to Criola. She has given the crown princess a letter to give to the empress. She's going to stay in the mincemeat and ale afterwords, but the party concocts a plan to sneak her into the royal docks: bribing the guards. She accepts, packs up her things, and joins the party.

Meanwhile, down in the bar, a dog comes up to Scipian and Vitaly, apparently interested in the cheese rolls. The two feed the dog, and it licks their hands. Astrid thinks there's something weird about the dog. Someone kicks it so hard it starts bleeing from the ears and it runs out of the tavern. Astrid asks Scipian to follow it, which he does, into an alleyway where there's a bloodstain quite high up a wall next to a rent between two houses. Scipian theorises that if the dog was a shapeshifter, it might have left the stain while reverting to human form.

He tries to vault up into the rent, but something distinctly human bites his hands and he falls back down, and heads back to the rest of the party, who are heading back to the boat. On the way they see a guard patrol and duck into a nearby alley to let them pass. Everyone is a bit tired and let Serego lead for about 10 minutes, until they realise that he's leading them through a series of alleyways that head into the Kremish district, which is clearly undesirable. We backtrack, but find the way out blocked by a cart in a T-junction within the alley, with the sounds of an argument nearby from the other side.

We try to get past, with some people slipping past the back, and Scipian climbing over the top. The man having an argument yells at Scipian as he climbs over - he has a crossbow pointed at him, and it appears he was having the argument on his own. Scipian blusters for a bit, giving Fatima, Jovian, Serego, and Criola enough time to get to the other side, but a gang of Krems lead by the lady who sold Jovian those cheese rolls (and also [[Meathead Ted]]) arrive behind the rest of the party, trapping them with the wagon at their back.

The lady explains that Meathead Ted is looking for revenge for his friends, who were killed for associating with [[Jan the Jagged]] by the [[Companions of Knut]]. Astrid points out that that party has almost completely dissolved, and [[Jovian Palantina|Jovian]], who did most of the killing, died and is now a freshwater spring, and [[Poleman]] is in [[Luruna]] somewhere.

Ted suggests he's already dealt with Poleman, and that he's going to kill Astrid now. Scipian (on behalf of everyone else) asks if he can leave, since he doesn't really have anything to do with this grudge, and with the cheese lady's approval everyone who'd got past the cart heads out, leaving Astrid and Quintus behind. By some stroke of luck, the cart unwedges itself and crashes into a wall, exploding flour everywhere at exactly the same time as Quintus charges into the gang. Astrid runs away to the sounds of several different people screaming in pain.

Everyone (other than Quintus) make it back safely to the royal docks. The guards ask who Criola is, as there's paperwork they need to fill in, and Fatima starts counting coins. After a moment, the guards agree that maybe paperwork isn't needed in this instance, requiring only 6 bronze between them. Once out of earshot, Criola is appalled that the guards have fallen so far as to accept bribes, and Scipian is appalled both that Fatima had been counting *bronze*, and that the guards had accepted been so cheap as to accept them.

Talia, 2nd of Autumn
moon: thin cresent, barely visible. waxing.

Fatima, Scipian, and Astrid went to a meeting about selling the trade ship. Representing the empire is the don and admiral Marcan Mimori (a member of his family has married into the Marsallases). They initially offer 30 silver, and Fatima haggles them up to 50 for the ship and a monopsony on the cargo. An inspection is arranged for Harla 2nd, two days from now.

Fatima's retainer picks the lock on Damian's lockbox, hoping to find the ship's manifest to determine the value of the cargo. The contents are underwhelming - low-grade iron ore, timber, clothing, and a single crate of two-dozen nivish longbows. Also in the box is a coat, a fine compass which Fatima takes, and series of personal letters which Fatima also takes.

In one of the letters, Martala (? a relative of Damian?) writes to Damian della Juno about the commission and why the he's going on this boat, about his favourite prostitute, and then there's a block of text that's completely indecipherable. Fatima gets Criola to try to crack it, and also takes a copy for herself.

Stell and Astrid have a private conversation in another room. She hopes to die in service of a noble cause, and requests a purpose from Astrid, who says she aims to take the throne of Virkvärg at risk of her own life, but not that of her family. Stell outlines the situation and offers her advice: [[Stell's Advice]]

Astrid gets stopped outside her room by Ranvig's huscarl, who is here to collect the will. Astrid and Aethild head out to the boat where the reliquary is, and note that there are two lights on, one on both of Fatima's boats. Fatima asks about the nivish code she's looking at, the huskal suggests that maybe someone in duruza could help. They open the reliquary and take the will and take it to ranvig.

Notes on [[Ranvig reading the will]] are on a different page in case you want to be left in suspense.

Mara 2nd of autumn, 172

Serego smuggles some grapes to Criola for breakfast, and asks for us to retrieve his stuff from the tavern and to tell his patients that he's indisposed. Aethild heads out on his own, but picks up Folvin the haughty courtier. He picks up the stuff and then heads to a courier (Sinoli and Son) to have them tell everyone. He haggles them down from 4B to 3B to 4B to zero, and then back up to 2B. 

They head back to the palace and Folvin whispers something to the guards and they act a little taken aback and let him through. Aethild takes him back to his room, and then breaks down crying and falls asleep. We learn that Don Marion Matolis's son, Vespin, had a dalliance with Folvin. Folvin had to escape out a window and broke his tibia.

Fatima returns to her room to find the door unlocked. The room is tidy, but all of her notes have been stolen.

---

hattie meeting one: joint ownership shipping lane between stravan and duruza. it's wool.


aethild animates [[Karishna]]'s right hand to find the person who stole all of fatima's stuff. It runs out of the room and down the corridoor, and down the stairs. Astrid falls over the stairs and grabs the banister, but trips Scipian up as he follows. It heads down, down, and down another set of stairs to the basement/servent's zone.

A few servents see us. Scipian barges past and Aethild invoke's Bertrand's name which allows the rest of them to get buy. The hand leads us to a door with a nameplate: "Lenora". Aethild doubles back to fetch Fatima, and once everyone has grouped up we bang on the door.

Apparantly she thought no-one was staying in the room and thought the documents might be relevant to the house, so brought them to the Majordomo. Everyone believes her for some reason, and we go see her boss, who retrieves the documents from a safe. They've been rebound, apparently by a scribe who spoke the languages(s) they were written in, who has since gone on leave.

Aethild attempts to slip a silver coin into Lenora's bag, and finds a scrapbook open with impressions of revic symbols. The party asks to take Lenora with us, and the Majordomo permits this (presuming that we'll be punishing her for her mistake somehow).

We exit out of the upper entrance to their office into a courtyard. Aethild, and a little bit of the others, break her down and she admits to taking them intentionally to copy some of the text in order to teach herself revic, as she wanted to send a letter to an estranged revic family member. Seeing she meant no harm, Fatima offers to translate and deliver her letter.

We go back to the boat to try to find the secret things. Scipian uses his Nivish intuition to determine there's probably some stuff hidden in a secret compartment, and Astrid uses her carpenter's intuition to determine where it is. There's a bag containing about 14 silver in various currencies, various daggers in varying sizes, and lots of face coverings in various types.

Fatima goes to her meeting. It's about joint ownership of a shipping lane between stravan and duruza, trading wool. She negotiates an extremely favourable deal, gaining a 1 (i think?) year monopoly on the wool supplied, with the expectation that it would be renewed if everything went well.

After a bit, a guard comes up to Astrid, Scipian, and Aethid, and says someone's at the guard house looking for us by the name of Quintus. He seems quite hurt. Aethild attempts to inspect his wound under the guise of treating it, but Quintus doesn't want it to be accidentally reopened. Aethild touches his hand as part of this, and it's stone cold.

Zombie Quintus lunges at Astrid and puts her in a chokehold. Scipian tries to pull his arms away but they're superhumanly strong. Aethild starts to draw a circle around him to banish the spirit possessing him. Scipian hacks off one of the arms, allowing Astrid to get a few breaths in, and then the circle is completed, Aethild recites a poem, and the body drops to the floor. Guards come in and ask some questions, bring a mortician who confirms that the body was dead before it came in, and let us go.

Another visitor at the other gate - it's [[Aulani Lavinia de Mervil]] asking us where Criola is. She updates us on the Mervil situation - [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] is dead, presumably killed by her father (although Lavinia obviously doesn't admit anything, even when read), and the Don [[Ludovic de Mervil]] has taken ill with a flare up of stress-induced rheumatism. The party denies knowing where Criola is, and says that she's been hopping between taverns to avoid being found.

The party briefly splits, with Scipian heading in the direction of the docks (although that way also lead to much of the city). Fatima notices that he's being followed, and catches up to ask for his help with something else instead.

Fatima decides that she wants to kill and eat Criola, to ensure that she is never captured.
