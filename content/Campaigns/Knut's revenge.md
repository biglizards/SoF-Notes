A trade ship leaves Nivena, loaded with valuable cargo and the arguably more valuable aristocrat (something) della Juno, guarded by his bodyguard (deryn's character) and the active battalion of the 72nd Century (which consists mostly of trainees). The ship is blown off course into shallow waters - Nivish trade ships typically stick to deeper waters to avoid the risk of running into Revic raiders.

A fleet of 12 longships leave the Marrow, each flying the flag of a different clan. They are bound to Duruza to attempt to negotiate a potential trade route between the two nations on behalf of the Marrowking. On their way, they encounter a trade ship blown off course, and several longships break formation to board it. The first to reach flies the flag of clan (hattie's clan), and their men stream onto the soon-to-be captured vessel.

They are met with some resistance, organised by Scipian Barbolan, commander of the Century, but the men are inexperienced and underprepared - it quickly becomes clear they could not fend off a single longship, let alone a dozen. (deryn) calls for a parley, demanding a dual with the Marrodic captain.

(hattie) steps onto the trade ship, and offers a compromise: in exchange for all goods on board, the ship would be taken to Duruza and sold, where all aboard would be safely escorted back to Nivina. (the della Juno), after some persuasion, agrees. The low-ranking soldiers who survived are stripped of their weapons and armour, and the fleet gained another ship.

Shortly after fleeing Mervil Manor, circling the estate to reach the road to Duruza, Astrid meet up with (hags) who, seeing the fight had already started and ended before he and his legionaries could intervene, had turned around and started walking back to the capital. The two reconcile and journey together, staying for several weeks as Astrid healed her wounds. (hags) found many jobs suitable for a baneman, more than enough to cover living expenses which included a barrel of mulled wine a week.

Having seen no advertisement of a ship bound for the Marrowlaw during their stay, the two sold their carriage to one Gnaesia Arcavo, a collector of antiquities who was very interested in its former owner, [[Karishna]]. (hags) describes her as a saint and recounts her death at the hand of a cursed ax - information which contradicted the official narrative, but when shown the weapon in question, along with Karisna's swish hands, Gnaesia parted with 10 silver (far more than market value) to buy the carriage and the ax. 

(hags) posts a notice that two people are willing to pay 5S each for passage to the Marrowlaw. A day later, a response, including a time and location for a meeting with the captain, is attached below, directing the pair to The Secret Basement, an upmarket dockside tavern. When they arrive, an underling hails them, and heads upstairs to fetch their captain. Coming down with them, however, is [[Rustia Criola de Mervil|Criola]], who apologies for what she describes as necessary deceit, as her father Duke [[Ludovic de Mervil]] has men hunting for her (and likely the party as well).

She informs them that her sister [[Rustia Nezetta de Mervil]] has disappeared, almost certainly by her father's hand after her failed insurrection against him. She cannot trust him any longer, after he had [[Jovian Palantina|Saint Jovian]] executed, and fled the house after gathering all the valuables she could and driving the remaining guests staying on the Manor grounds into an uproar (after which they were all expelled).

She begs of what remains of the Companions of Knut to either arrange an audience with the empress, although she knows not what good this would do nor how they would achieve this; or to take her with them to the Marrowlaw such that she may cultivate power and one day return to secure her birthright.

A town crier takes their stand to inform the citizens of Duruza that a fleet of Revic ships would soon be arriving, and that, as they are part of a diplomatic mission and have no hostile intent, there is no reason to panic. Astrid pushes her way down to the docks, looking at the flags on the horizon for that of her own clan, Verkvarg. She does not find it, but among the familiar Marrodic clans she finds a flag of unknown design - a snake emerging from a horn - attached to a ship of unfamiliar make.
