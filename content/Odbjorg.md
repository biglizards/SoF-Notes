A speaker from clan Veder. Specialises in speaking to wind spirits, and does not like (or is unable?) to perform offensive hexes.

Was contracted by Aethild to put a wind spirit on guard at the entrance to the Luca-Lenna (which successfully killed a spy).

Was on the ship when Astrid using magic to cause the gangplank to break. She noticed this, and presumably dislikes Astrid for using her magic dishonourably.

Was supplied by [[Ranvig]] to [[Companions of Knutsdir]] to fight the [[Bjarni's Blood Brothers]].
